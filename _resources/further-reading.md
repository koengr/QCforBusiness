Below, we give a selection of recommended sources to learn more about this fascinating topic.

## I want to learn the technical details

### For (older) high school students:
{: .no_toc }

(or those who followed high-school level mathematics):

- [***Quantum Quest***](http://www.quantum-quest.org/) \[Book/website\] is an intensive five-week online course about the theory (mathematics) of quantum computing. Materials are freely available for self-study. 

- [***Quantum in Pictures***](https://www.quantinuum.com/news/quantum-in-pictures) (Cooke) \[Book\] teaches the theory (mathematics) of quantum computing using diagrams.

### Undergraduate (Bachelor’s) university level:
{: .no_toc }

- [**Quantum.Country**](https://quantum.country/qcvc) \[Website\] – the ‘Duolingo of Quantum Computing’, a very well-written introduction for those with a late high-school or early university-level math background. 

- [***Quantum Computation and Quantum Information***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Computation_and_Quantum_Information) (Nielsen, Chuang) \[Book\] – the ‘bible of quantum computing’. Perhaps not the most up-to-date, but definitely the most well-known resource in our field. Sets the standards for jargon and notation. 

<!-- -->

- *[**Quantum Computer Science: An Introduction**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/quantum-computer-science/66462590D10C8010017CF1D7C45708D7) *(Mermin) \[Book\] – a well-written introduction, with quite some focus on manipulating quantum circuits.

- *[**Quantum Computing Since Democritus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Computing_Since_Democritus) *(Aaronson) \[Book\] – Aaronson is an authority in the field. His book touches upon many topics, such as the foundations of computer science, black holes and consciousness, making it a good read for those looking for something much broader than just quantum computing.

### Graduate (Master’s) level:
{: .no_toc }

These assume no prior knowledge about quantum physics but require a strong background in mathematics (i.e. linear algebra, calculus, advanced inequality bounds and approximations, etc.). In exchange, they go into much more detail. 

- [**Lecture Notes for UvA course ‘Quantum Computing’ by Ronald de Wolf**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09415), which is frequently updated and features some cutting-edge algorithms. Via the [course website](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/qc24.html), you can find the link and password to view all the recorded lectures.

- [**Lecture Notes for Caltech course ‘Quantum Computing’ by John Preskil **](http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/ph229/)

### Scientific overview papers
{: .no_toc }

The papers below are aimed at scientists from fields other than quantum computing itself. All papers we mention are open-access and peer-reviewed, making them very suitable for citation. 

- **‘[Quantum Algorithms: An Overview](https://www.nature.com/articles/npjqi201523)’** (Ashley Montanaro)

- **‘[The Potential Impact of Quantum Computers on Society](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05380)’** (Ronald de Wolf), also available as [recorded lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ych-yB9QP_A).

### Scientific opinions and discussions
{: .no_toc }

- [**Scott Aaronson’s blog**](https://scottaaronson.com/blog). Although written from a theoretical computer science perspective, this blog addresses a very broad range of quantum computing topics. Prof. Aaronson has a strong authority in the field, and his posts attract readership and comments from a broad range of prominent scientists. 

## I want to learn to program a quantum computer

Several programming packages for quantum computers exist, mostly maintained by major hardware providers. All of them offer great introductory tutorials. The ones we recommend below are all in Python. 

- [**Qiskit**](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/), the language by IBM, probably features the largest catalogue of learning materials. To start from scratch, we recommend following the ‘[Basics of Quantum Information](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/basics-of-quantum-information/single-systems)’, which teaches both the mathematics behind qubits and the usage of the package itself.

- [**Cirq**](https://quantumai.google/cirq/) is a very similar package developed by Google. As of 2024, they have a [more focused tutorial](https://quantumai.google/cirq/start/) to explain the programming package itself without extensive theory of quantum mechanics.

- [**QWorld Bronze **](https://qworld.net/workshop-bronze/)offers tutorials in the form of Jupyter notebooks and hosts various training days around the world, mostly focused on Qiskit and sometimes ProjectQ.

- [**PennyLane**](https://pennylane.ai/) is a package by startup Xanadu with a strong focus on machine learning applications.

- [**Classiq**](https://www.classiq.io/) is one of the largest players that focuses on a higher-level programming language. This makes it easier to re-use code and to synthesise circuits for different types of hardware, but it also requires more background knowledge to get started.

### Major business conferences
{: .no_toc }

- [**Q2B (organised by QCWare)**](https://q2b.qcware.com/)

- [**IQT (Inside Quantum Technology)**](http://iqtevent.com/)

- [**Quantum.Tech (organised by Alpha Events)**](https://new.quantumtechdigital.co.uk/)

- [**Commercialising Quantum (organised by The Economist)**](https://events.economist.com/commercialising-quantum/)

### Major scientific conferences
{: .no_toc }

The following are very technical and only recommended for those acquainted with the field. They take place at a different location each year.

- [**Quantum Information Processing (QIP)**](https://qipconference.org/)

- [**Theory of Quantum Computation, Communication and Cryptography (TQC)**](https://tqc-conference.org/)

- [**Quantum Computing Theory in Practice (QCTIP)**](https://www.qctip2024.com/) (mostly based in the UK)

### Business News 
{: .no_toc }

- [***Quantum Computing Report***](https://quantumcomputingreport.com/news/) - don’t be fooled by the basic look on the website. The content is written with a very critical eye and with very relevant contextual information, making it our favourite source for quantum-related news.  

<!-- -->

- [***The Quantum Insider***](https://thequantuminsider.com/)

### Scientific news
{: .no_toc }

The sources below do not focus exclusively on Quantum Technology, but offer high-quality scientific news (and surely none would miss any important quantum breakthroughs). 

- [***Quanta Magazine***](https://www.quantamagazine.org/)

- [**Phys.org**](https://phys.org/)

## I want to learn more about business implications

Several sources cover similar topics as this book. Most of these come from consultants of hardware providers who have a financial interest in making others get started with quantum. In our opinion, the articles are sometimes too optimistic and predict that quantum applications will come much sooner than the typical expert would anticipate. On the other hand, they collect insightful details about financial matters. 

- **McKinsey** publishes yearly ‘[*Quantum Technology Monitor*](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/steady-progress-in-approaching-the-quantum-advantage)’ reports, focusing on the economic impact that quantum computers will have.

- **Cloudflare**’s support pages contain an incredibly complete [bible of Post-Quantum Cryptography.](https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024)

- Are you looking for a much more extensive source that covers pretty much everything there is to know about quantum computers? French consultant **Olivier Ezratty** regularly updates a 1500+ page book, [*Understanding Quantum Technologies*](https://www.oezratty.net/wordpress/2024/understanding-quantum-technologies-2024/).

### Workshops and trainings
{: .no_toc }

Short workshops will likely cover content similar to this book. A one-afternoon training can be particularly useful to inspire your colleagues and friends.

- [**The Workshop General Awareness Quantum Computing**](https://www.quantum.amsterdam/education/workshops-and-training/) follows the same philosophy as this book: an introduction to business opportunities that should be understandable for everyone.

- [**Qureca**](https://www.qureca.com/training/) is a British startup that offers several trainings, such as ‘Quantum for Everyone’ and ‘Quantum Training for Business’.
