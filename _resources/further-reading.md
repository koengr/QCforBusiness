# Further reading

Below, we give a selection of recommended sources to learn more about
this fascinating topic.

## I want to learn the technical details

### For (late) high school students:

(or those who followed high-school level mathematics):

- [**Quantum Quest**](http://new.quantum-quest.nl/) \[Book/website\] is
  an intensive 5-week online course about the theory (mathematics) of
  quantum computing. Materials are freely available for self-study. 

- [**Quantum in
  Pictures**](https://www.quantinuum.com/news/quantum-in-pictures)
  (Cooke) \[Book\] teaches the theory (mathematics) of quantum computing
  using diagrams.

### Undergraduate (Bachelor's) university level:

- [**Quantum.Country**](https://quantum.country/qcvc) \[Website\] – the
  “Duolingo of Quantum Computing”, a very well-written introduction for
  those with late high-school or early university level math
  background. 

- [**Quantum Computation and Quantum
  Information**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Computation_and_Quantum_Information) (Nielsen,
  Chuang) \[Book\] – the “bible of quantum computing”. Perhaps not the
  most up-to-date, but definitely the most well-known resource in our
  field. Sets the standards for jargon and notation. 

<!-- -->

- [**Quantum Computer Science: An
  Introduction**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/quantum-computer-science/66462590D10C8010017CF1D7C45708D7) (Mermin) \[Book\]
  – a well-written introduction, with quite some focus on manipulating
  quantum circuits.

- [**Quantum Computing Since
  Democritus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Computing_Since_Democritus) (Aaronson)
  \[Book\] – Aaronson is an authority in the field. His book touched
  upon many topics such as the foundations of computer science, black
  holes and consciousness, making it a good read for those looking for
  something much more broad than just quantum computing.

### Graduate (Master's) level:

These assume no prior knowledge about quantum physics, but require a
strong background in mathematics (i.e. linear algebra, calculus,
advanced inequality bounds and approximations, etc.). In exchange, they
go into much more detail. 

- **[Lecture Notes for UvA course “Quantum Computing” by Ronald de
  Wolf](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09415),** which is frequently updated
  and features some cutting-edge algorithms. Via the [course
  website](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/qc22.html), you can find
  the link and password to view all the recorded lectures too.

  Preskil **](http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/ph229/)

### Scientific overview papers

The papers below are aimed at scientists from fields other than quantum
computing itself. All papers we mention are open-access and
peer-reviewed, making them very suitable for citation. 

- [**Quantum algorithms: an
  overview**](https://www.nature.com/articles/npjqi201523) (Ashley
  Montanaro)

- [**The Potential Impact of Quantum Computers on
  Society**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05380) (Ronald de Wolf)
  \[[**video lecture**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ych-yB9QP_A)\]

### Scientific opinions and discussions

- [**Scott Aaronson’s blog**](https://scottaaronson.com/blog). Although
  written from a theoretical computer science perspective, this blog
  addresses a very broad range of quantum computing topics. Prof.
  Aaronson has a strong authority in the field, and his posts attract
  readership and comments from a broad range of prominent scientists. 

## I want to learn to program a quantum computer

Several programming packages for quantum computers exist, mostly
maintained by major hardware providers. All of them offer great
introductory tutorials. The ones we recommend below are all in Python. 

- [**Qiskit**](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/), the language by IBM,
  probably features the largest catalogue of learning materials. To
  start from scratch, we recommend following the “[Basics of Quantum
  Information](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/basics-of-quantum-information/single-systems)”,
  which teaches both the mathematics behind qubits and the usage of the
  package itself.

- [**Cirq**](https://quantumai.google/cirq/) is a very similar package
  developed by Google. As of 2024, they have a [more focused
  tutorial](https://quantumai.google/cirq/start/) to explain the
  programming package itself, without extensive theory of quantum
  mechanics.

- [**QWorld Bronze **](https://qworld.net/workshop-bronze/)offers
  tutorials in the form of Jupyter notebooks and hosts various training
  days around the world, mostly focused on Qiskit and sometimes
  ProjectQ.

- [**PennyLane**](https://pennylane.ai/) is a package by startup Xanadu
  with a strong focus on machine learning applications.

## I want to stay up-to-date with the latest developments

### Major conferences

- [**Q2B (organized by QCWare)**](https://q2b.qcware.com/)

- [**IQT (Inside Quantum Technology)**](http://iqtevent.com/)

- [**Quantum.Tech (organized by Alpha
  Events)**](https://new.quantumtechdigital.co.uk/)

- [**Commercializing Quantum (organized by The
  Economist)**](https://events.economist.com/commercialising-quantum/)

### Business News 

- [**Quantum Computing
  Report**](https://quantumcomputingreport.com/news/) - don’t be fooled
  by the basic look on the website. The content is written with a very
  critical eye and with very relevant contextual information, making
  them our favourite source for quantum-related news.  

<!-- -->

- [**The Quantum Insider**](https://thequantuminsider.com/)

### Scientific news

None of these focus exclusively on Quantum Technology, but all offer
high-quality news (and surely none would miss any important quantum
breakthroughs). 

- [**Quanta Magazine**](https://www.quantamagazine.org/)

- [**Phys.org**](https://phys.org/)

## I want to learn more about business implications

Several sources cover similar topics as this book. Most of these come
from consultants of hardware providers who have a financial interest in
making others get started with quantum. In our opinion, the articles are
sometimes too optimistic and predict that quantum applications will come
much sooner than the typical expert would anticipate. On the other hand,
they collect insightful details about financial matters. 

- **McKinsey** publishes yearly “Quantum Technology Monitor” reports,
  focusing on the economic impact the quantum computers will have. [Here
  is the 2024
  edition](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/steady-progress-in-approaching-the-quantum-advantage).

- **Cloudlfare**’s support pages contain an incredibly complete [bible
  of Post-Quantum Cryptography.](https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024)

### Workshops and trainings

These might not be the most relevant if you completed this book, by can
be particularly useful to inspire your colleagues.

- [**The Workshop General Awareness Quantum
  Computing**](https://new.quantum.amsterdam/education/education-workshops/)
  follows the same philosophy as this book: an introduction to business
  opportunities that should be understandable for everyone.

- [**Qureca**](https://www.qureca.com/training/) is a british startup
  that offers several trainings, such as “Quantum for everyone” and
  “Quantum Training for Business”.
