As far back as 1981, physicist Richard Feynman ended a conference talk with a famous <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02650179">quote</a>, hinting at the opportunities of quantum computing<sup id="fnref:29" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“I’m not happy with all the analyses that go with just the classical theory, because nature isn’t classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you’d better make it quantum mechanical”.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Since then, scientists found increasingly sophisticated algorithms to mimic nature on quantum devices. In this chapter, we will address the impact quantum computing may have on chemistry and material science, discuss the most relevant algorithms, and analyze why the enzyme FeMoco receives such widespread attention.</p> <h3 id="what-problems-in-chemistry-and-material-science-will-we-solve"> <a href="#what-problems-in-chemistry-and-material-science-will-we-solve" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="what-problems-in-chemistry-and-material-science-will-we-solve"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> What problems in chemistry and material science will we solve? </h3> <p>The computational problems that chemists care about typically come in two flavours. The most studied problem is finding the arrangement of particles that has the lowest possible energy, which we call the <em>ground state</em>. In nature, we often find a system in (or close to) its ground state. In the context of molecules, the atomic nuclei are relatively heavy, while the lightweight electrons move much faster and are more prone to be entangled or in a quantum superposition. Therefore, chemists tend to make approximations that allow them to focus primarily on the positions and spins of the electrons: the <em>electronic structure problem.</em></p> <p>The other problem is about dynamics: given some initial configuration of particles, how do they reconfigure themselves after a certain amount of time? This is often referred to as the <em>(time) evolution</em> of a system. Both problems are often informally referred to as <em>‘quantum simulation’</em>.</p> <p>We often receive the question: why is it so hard to simulate quantum mechanics on a <em>classical</em> computer? Intuitively, the problem arises when we deal with many particles that exhibit large amounts of superposition and entanglement, such that the location of one particle is heavily dependent on the (undecided) position of many other particles. We call such states <em>strongly correlated</em>. The computational problems arise because we may need to keep track of all the possible locations that particle A can be, but also all the locations of particle B, and the same for particle C, etcetera, which quickly winds up to an <em>exponential</em> number of possible sets of conditional locations. In other words, the number of relevant <em>amplitudes</em> (see the section <u>What is quantum?)</u> that we need to keep track of, grows very quickly. Even with a mere one hundred particles, brute-force simulation is far beyond the capabilities of the world’s best supercomputers.</p> <p>It is a common misconception that quantum computers straightforwardly offer an exponential advantage compared to classical computers for all chemistry problems. An influential recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37587-6">paper</a> reports<sup id="fnref:30" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“[…] we conclude that evidence for such an exponential advantage across chemical space has yet to be found. While quantum computers may still prove useful for ground-state quantum chemistry through polynomial speedups, it may be prudent to assume exponential speedups are not generically available for this problem.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Note that this comment is specifically about finding <em>ground states,</em> which is still arguably the most relevant problem in chemistry. There is still ample evidence that quantum computers offer an exponential speedup for <em>time evolutions.</em></p> <p>There is more bad news for quantum computers. Over the years, computational chemists have found brilliant hacks and optimisations to work around the classical computer’s bottlenecks, which has raised a high bar before a quantum computer can meaningfully compete. For nearly every problem in chemistry, there appears to be a clever trick to run this somewhat efficiently on a classical machine. For a quantum killer application, we likely need to search in a fairly specific niche, right at the sweet spot where classical methods struggle while a quantum computer excels. It is not entirely clear how large this niche is, and it is an active research area to identify more systems where classical methods fall short. To illustrate, a recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02411-5">review article</a> states<sup id="fnref:31" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>[Classical methods struggle with] multi-metal systems, where multiple metal ions are in similar electronic environments and interactions. These appear in some biological systems, including enzymes (for example, FeMoco and P450), but it is unclear how common they are or what the added value of an accurate system description would be.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Still, there seems to be realistic hope that quantum computers can, at the very least, make tangible contributions within niche areas. The first end-users will most likely be scientists who study the fundamentals of quantum systems, as is already done in physics experiments today. We wouldn’t call these devices computers yet, but rather ‘analogue simulators’. One of the first actual ‘computer’ applications could be to study models of quantum materials, such as the famous <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04940-6">Hubbard model</a><sup id="fnref:32" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p> <p>Looking at more commercially relevant applications, the aforementioned multi-metal systems are often cited, which are relevant to calculating ligand binding affinities in drugs and understanding the mechanism behind the biological production of ammonia. We study the latter example at the end of this chapter. Another potential area could be to understand and search for high-temperature, superconductors<sup id="fnref:33" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. It is hard to say what the impact of quantum computers will be beyond these niche areas, as this will depend strongly on the usefulness of small polynomial speedups and unpredictable breakthroughs in quantum algorithms. We see a broad palette of applications that are proposed, such as water splitting (to efficiently produce hydrogen as fuel), carbon capture mechanisms<sup id="fnref:34" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, the study of efficient solar cells and the development of higher capacity batteries.</p> <h3 id="algorithms-for-quantum-chemistry"> <a href="#algorithms-for-quantum-chemistry" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="algorithms-for-quantum-chemistry"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Algorithms for quantum chemistry </h3> <p>Three quantum methods deserve to be mentioned. The first is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-evolving_block_decimation"><strong>Trotter-Suzuki</strong></a> method, sometimes called ‘Trotterization’, which simulates time evolution. In this case, we assume that the initial state is encoded in the qubits of the quantum computer. The Trotter-Suzuki method is guaranteed to return a good approximation of the state at a later time, again encoded in the qubit registers.</p> <p>The most common tool for finding a ground state is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_phase_estimation_algorithm"><strong>quantum phase estimation (QPE)</strong></a>, which reports the energy of a certain quantum state. As a subroutine, it requires some evolution method, like Trotter-Suzuki. Unfortunately, it will only succeed in finding the ground state if it gets as input a state that is a reasonable approximation to the ground state. This shifts the problem to: how do we produce a good candidate for the ground state?</p> <p>The most popular algorithm for creating states with certain properties is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_quantum_eigensolver"><strong>variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)</strong></a>. This is an example of a variational quantum circuit: a series of gates that can be gradually changed until the output matches certain requirements. Just like other variational approaches, it is a heuristic algorithm, lacking rigorous guarantees that it will produce the desired output in a reasonable time.</p> <p>Creating a good approximation to a ground state is, in general, NP-hard. This means that it is extremely unlikely that a rigorous algorithm for this task will be found. On the other hand, there is good hope that more <em>heuristic</em> methods (just like VQE) will be found that work well on certain subsets of problems (for example, the kind of molecules frequently encountered in the human body). In fact, such heuristic methods already form the workhorse of classical computational chemistry, with tools such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory">Density functional theory (DFT)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_interaction">Configuration Interaction (CI)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Monte_Carlo">Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)</a>, although these are too slow to address very large systems such as drugs<sup id="fnref:35" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p> <p>A typical workflow for finding a ground state on a quantum computer could be as follows: We construct a quantum circuit that first performs a VQE, followed by QPE on the output of the variational circuit. This way, the output of the circuit represents the energy of the state produced by the VQE. We then allow a classical optimiser to run this circuit many times, gradually changing the parameters of the VQE until the lowest possible energy is found.</p> <p>Needless to say, there exist various more technical and more sophisticated methods, for which we refer to other more technical sources, such as:</p> <p>TODO</p> <h3 id="a-hype-around-quantum-computing-for-climate-changes"> <a href="#a-hype-around-quantum-computing-for-climate-changes" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="a-hype-around-quantum-computing-for-climate-changes"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> A hype around quantum computing for climate changes </h3> <p>Some sources make spectacular (but extremely dubious) claims about how quantum computing could be a key ingredient to solve climate change, thanks to the boost to R&amp;D on batteries, carbon capture, and more efficient chemical processes. But McKinsey takes the biscuit with their report titled “Quantum computing just might save the planet”<sup id="fnref:36" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>. We’ll remain agnostic as to whether the impact of chemistry R&amp;D is really sufficient to save the planet, but the claim of quantum computing as a saviour is especially ridiculous because it will still take several years before these machines are sufficiently mature. To limit global warming to no more than 1.5° C, we need to take action much sooner. Imperial College London writes on their website<sup id="fnref:37" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>, referencing the 2014 IPCC report:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Limiting warming to 1.5°C will only be possible if global emissions peak within the next few years, and then start to decline rapidly, halving by 2030.”</p> </blockquote> <p>At the same time, our chapter on timelines shows that it is exceedingly unlikely that serious quantum utility in chemistry R&amp;D is possible anywhere before the 2030s.</p> <p>Nevertheless, it’s interesting to look at one of the ‘killer applications’ often mentioned in this context: a use case that has both 1) a convincing quantum speedup and 2) serious real-world impact. We’ll zoom in on the molecule FeMoco, which precisely has a multi-metal system that classical methods struggle with. To understand the relevance of this molecule, we need to dive into the world of food production.</p> <h3 id="a-case-study-of-a-promising-enzyme-femoco"> <a href="#a-case-study-of-a-promising-enzyme-femoco" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="a-case-study-of-a-promising-enzyme-femoco"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> A case study of a promising enzyme: FeMoco </h3> <p><img src=" /media/image17.png" style="width:1.33333in" /></p> <p>Chemical structure of the FeMo cofactor, taken from Wikimedia.</p> <p>Today’s agriculture relies heavily on the use of artificial fertilizer to grow our crops. Without large-scale use of supplementary nutrients, it would be problematic to feed our world’s huge population. In fact, about <a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/86/i33/Haber-Bosch-Reaction-Early-Chemical.html">half of the nitrogen atoms</a> in our body have previously passed a fertilizer factory!</p> <p>Unfortunately, the production of fertilizer involves enormous energy consumptions and carbon emissions. The main culprit is the ingredient ammonia (NH3), of which we use as much as <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1065865/ammonia-production-capacity-globally/">230 Mton per year</a>. Although our air consists mainly of molecular nitrogen (N2), plants cannot directly absorb this. Instead, they rely on bacteria (or, in the case of artificial fertilizer, humans) to perform so-called nitrogen fixation, breaking the strong triple bond of molecular nitrogen and converting this into ammonia. Microorganisms can convert this into further nitrogen-containing compounds that can be absorbed by the root system.</p> <p>Pretty much all of the world’s ammonia production follows the so-called Haber-Bosch process, where hydrogen gas (H2) and nitrogen gas (N2) react together to form ammonia. The process can be implemented in large, high-yield production lines, but also comes with a major disadvantage: its staggering energy consumption. This is mainly due to two essential steps: producing sufficiently pure hydrogen and nitrogen gasses, and later separating the H2 and N2 molecules into individual atoms. The latter is especially challenging for N2 due to its strong triple bond. To achieve this, factories operate at extreme conditions, with high temperatures (~400 degrees Celsius) and high pressure, largely driven by natural gas. As much as <a href="https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/low-carbon-energy-programme/green-ammonia/">1.8% of the world’s CO2 emission</a> is caused by factories performing such reactions, consuming around 3-5% of the world’s natural gas production!</p> <p>Can’t this be done more efficiently? In this case, we strongly suspect so. Certain bacteria are also capable of making ammonia, but in a much more efficient way: without high temperatures or high pressure. It would be extremely valuable to copy this trick.</p> <p>To imitate the bacteria, we need to better understand a particular substance, the FeMo cofactor (short: FeMoco), which acts as a catalytic active site during ammonia production. A perfect simulation of FeMoco is not possible on classical computers, as the structure of roughly 120 strongly reacting electrons rapidly becomes intractable. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/29/7555">Researchers from ETH Zurich and Microsoft</a> were the first to recognize that a quantum computer may aid in a more accurate study of FeMoco. A few years later, researchers at Google gave a more concrete prediction: with about <a href="https://www.quantum.amsterdam/part-3-the-search-for-a-killer-application-with-a-closer-look-at-artificial-fertilizer/o%09https:/journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.030305">4 million qubits and 4 days of computing time</a>, a single simulation could be accomplished.</p> <p>With FeMoco, we seem to finally have an example that confidently ticks all the boxes for quantum utility: classical methods are limited, we have well-understood quantum methods, and computational results have a significant commercial and societal impact. Unfortunately, there is yet another catch – innovation never comes so easily. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11235">A recent article</a><sup id="fnref:38" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> quotes that industrial production of a ton of Ammonia costs around 26 GJ of energy, compared to at least 24 GJ (estimated) in bacteria. This is indeed not the massive reduction we were hoping for. The article concludes that perhaps the true value lies in a better understanding of this process:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“The chemical motivation to study nitrogenase is thus less to produce an energy-efficient replacement of the Haber-Bosch process but rather because it is an interesting system in its own right, and perhaps it may motivate how to understand and design other catalysts that can activate and break the nitrogen-nitrogen triple-triple bond under ambient conditions.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>As a final note, we want to stress that quantum computers do not magically spit out recipes for fertilizers, nor for medicines, batteries, or catalysts. For real breakthroughs, we need a team of chemists, engineers, and other experts, who spend several years to run experiments, have discussions, employ computer simulations, make mistakes, go back to the drawing board a few times, and slowly converge to practical solutions. We should not forget that quantum computers merely provide a new set of tools. The best we can hope for is that smart people will use them in the right way!</p> <p>Further reading:</p> <ul> <li> <p>(Scientific article) Toward the first quantum simulation with quantum speedup <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1801723115">https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1801723115</a></p> </li> <li> <p>(2022 review article) Prospects of quantum computing for molecular sciences <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41313-021-00039-z">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41313-021-00039-z</a></p> </li> <li> <p>(2019 review article) Quantum Chemistry in the Age of Quantum Computing <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00803">https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00803</a></p> </li> </ul> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:29" role="doc-endnote"> <p>Feynman, R.P.
