And it’s still relevant to push the limits of innovation, with <a href="https://www.rug.nl/news/2019/12/molecular-motors-and-switches?lang=en">nano-cars that consist of just a few atoms</a>, or <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2012.9747">ever-smaller transistors on computer chips</a> on the horizon.</p> <p>Just ahead of us is a new paradigm, which we’ll call quantum technology. The distinguishing factor is that it goes further than merely building stuff from small particles. Quantum technology is about devices that perform certain processes in a fundamentally different way. That is, the data (or operations) we work with can have special properties unique to quantum physics, such as superposition and entanglement.</p> <p>In our jargon, we will refer to ‘classical’ technology for devices that don’t carefully exploit the possibilities of quantum physics – they are based on ‘classical’ physics that we’re used to from high school. Your laptop and phone are examples of classical computers, and they’re connected to the classical internet. The internal transistors and electrical circuits might be so tiny that quantum physics is relevant there, but the fundamental point is that the information that they process is purely classical. Whereas classical computers work with ‘bits’, quantum technology will store information in something called ‘quantum bits’, or shortly ‘qubits’. Generally, under the nomer of <strong>quantum technology</strong>, we distinguish four categories:</p> <p>Quantum Computers</p> <p>Quantum computers are devices that use quantum physics to perform automatic calculations to solve a problem. Computing is considered the most impactful application for most organisations, and therefore, it’s the main focus of this book. </p> <p>Quantum Networks</p> <p>Quantum networks are connections between quantum devices over which <em>qubits</em> (or similar forms of quantum data)<em> </em>can be transmitted. The most relevant use case is to strengthen cryptography used by classical computers, but there are many more applications.</p> <p>Quantum Sensors</p> <p>Quantum sensors are devices that exploit the effects of quantum physics to accurately measure certain quantities, such as a magnetic field or the strength of the earth’s gravity. Quantum clocks also fall into this category. </p> <p>Quantum Simulators</p> <p>Quantum simulators are devices similar to quantum computers, except that they specialise in solving a limited set of problems. Typically, they are built to reproduce the behaviour of atoms and electrons in a molecule or a piece of material, allowing us to measure properties like energies and reaction rates.</p> <p>In this book, we mainly focus on <strong>computers </strong>and <strong>networks</strong>: simply because these seem to have the biggest impact on typical (business) users.</p> <p>###</p> <h3 id="the-importance-of-high-performance-computing"> <a href="#the-importance-of-high-performance-computing" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="the-importance-of-high-performance-computing"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> The importance of high-performance computing </h3> <p>The abundance of cheap computational power has given humanity incredible wealth. We automated the most tedious tasks to free up time for leisure and to solve other urgent problems. It allowed us to scale factories, supply chains and logistics to unprecedented sizes, allowing us to transport resources around the globe at minimal costs. Computer chips, aeroplane wings, heart monitors, and LCD screens have improved with every generation.</p> <p>Today, our computers are already incredibly fast. In fact, for many applications, there is little economic gain in making these computers even faster. Decades-old machines can successfully oversee factory operations, and writing a Word document or scheduling a meeting with 8 busy colleagues is not limited by faster computers in any way.</p> <p>However, this book specifically is about the applications where we are still hungry for more computational power. If only we could feed more data into weather models, our forecasts would become more accurate. If staff rostering would take less time, we could take better take last-minute changes into account. Accurate predictions of drug reactivity in a human body could save on costly medical trials and reduce the time to market. Machine learning models like ChatGPT are still demanding more training hours to produce more sophisticated results.</p> <p>It should be clear that we’re not talking about computations that happen on your laptop. We’re thinking of problems where somehow there’s value in investing in the fastest possible computers on earth: <strong>high-performance computing (HPC)</strong>, colloquially called <em>supercomputers</em><strong>.</strong> Merely looking at the market, there seems to be incredible value computing stuff: companies and academics spend tens of billions of dollars on them<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and Nvidia recently became the most valuable company on earth by leading the market of special purpose Graphical Processing Units (GPU’s).</p> <p>###</p> <h3 id="why-can-quantum-computers-have-an-advantage"> <a href="#why-can-quantum-computers-have-an-advantage" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="why-can-quantum-computers-have-an-advantage"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Why can quantum computers have an advantage?  </h3> <p>Quantum computers are devices that perform automatic computations at our command, very much like their classical counterparts. The ‘quantum’ part stems from the fact that it can actually exploit the laws of quantum mechanics. This should be contrasted to our conventional ‘classical’ computers, which technically can also be completely described by quantum mechanics, but they just happen to also work fine according to classical physics. By no means are they supposed to ever deal with quantum phenomena like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition">superposition</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement">entanglement</a>. Contrarily, a proper quantum computer does exploit these purely quantum mechanical effects. </p> <p>A naive view of quantum computers is that they’re simply <em>faster</em> than their conventional cousins. Or perhaps one may naively point at Moore’s Law: with transistors reaching atomic scales, we run into quantum effects, so quantum physics may help us make better chips. However, none of these are our core motivations for looking at quantum computers. </p> <p>Firstly, <strong>quantum computers are much, much slower than conventional computers,</strong> if one focuses on their ‘time to perform a basic step’. A modern CPU can handle 64-bit numbers (meaning that arbitrary numbers up to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (!) can be processed). It can perform basic arithmetic like addition, multiplication, and so forth on these numbers, essentially in one single ‘step’. The speed of a modern CPU is incredible: a modern Intel or AMD processor works at a rate of several GHz, that is, several billions of steps per second. There’s no way a human can possibly keep up with such speeds when it comes to plain calculations! </p> <p>Now, quantum computers are supposed to be even faster, right? Well, it’s not hard to find backing for that claim: </p> <p><img src=" /media/image8.png" style="width:4.44635in" /></p> <p><img src=" /media/image9.png" style="width:5.06565in" /></p> <p>However, you may be disappointed to hear that quantum computers, at this moment, cannot even add or multiply numbers of more than 3 or 4 bits. And even if they could, their rate of operation would by no means reach several GHz, but more likely several MHz (a few <em>million</em> operations per second), at best. In other words, they’re more than a thousand times <em>slower. </em>To make things worse, the information in quantum computers is extremely fragile and needs to be constantly checked and corrected, using so-called <strong>error correction</strong><em>. </em>This is a form of overhead that could make quantum computers another several orders of magnitude slower. Even in the far future, when quantum computers are more mature and more reliable, we still expect them to be much slower than the classical chips at that time. </p> <p>How does this rhyme with the news about ever-faster quantum computers? And why are we still interested in these slow machines? As we claimed before, we hope to do certain computations in a <strong>fundamentally different way</strong>. Let’s look at a beautiful analogy that Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen bring up in their online course <a href="https://quantum.country/">Quantum.country</a>. </p> <p><img src=" /media/image10.jpeg" style="width:3.86142in" /></p> <p>Imagine that you’d like to travel from Morocco to Spain. If your technology does not allow you to cross the Strait of Gibraltar (say, you have access to a car but not a boat), then you’d need to take an incredible detour: all the way through North Africa, past the Arabian Peninsula, and through Europe, before you can reach your destination. This represents the steps taken by a classical computer. In the same analogy, a quantum computer grants you the ability to traverse both land and sea (much like a hovercraft). The fundamentally new possibilities that quantum offers allow us to do computations in <em>fewer steps</em>: even with a slower vehicle (computer), one may arrive at the destination sooner. In fact, this advantage often grows as problems become larger and more complicated. It is still an active area of research to completely map the landscape over which quantum computers can travel and, hence, to determine which problems can be sped up and which cannot. </p> <p>I like this analogy because it indicates that some problems can profit greatly from a quantum computer, whereas many won’t: you would not want to travel by hovercraft from Amsterdam to Berlin. For this reason, we don’t expect that classical computers will be ‘replaced’ any time soon. Instead, different types of processors (CPUs, GPUs, quantum computers) are expected to co-exist. GPU and Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) are special-purpose devices, meant to only do tricks that they happen to be good at.</p> <p>In the analogy with the Strait of Gibraltar, the precise route that you travel denotes the chosen <strong>algorithm</strong>. An algorithm is a step-by-step list of instructions that describes how a computational problem should be solved. The ‘steps’<em> </em>here should be sufficiently simple so that it is completely unambiguously how to do them. They could be operations such as adding, multiplying, or comparing two numbers. Needless the say, the fewer steps the algorithm requires, the better.</p> <p>By exploiting quantum mechanics, a quantum computer introduces new basic steps (like crossing the sea) that are impossible to perform on a classical computer. For example, the previous chapter introduced quantum logic gates that generalise operations like AND and OR. Using these building blocks, we can formulate quantum algorithms that might take fewer steps than the best classical algorithm ever could!</p> <p>A recurring theme in this book is the search for quantum algorithms with a significant advantage over their classical counterparts. This turns out to be more challenging than it seems at first sight: the algorithm must have a significant advantage to compensate for the ‘slowness’ of the quantum computer, and the number of algorithms that accomplish this is still quite small. We might go as far as to say that, even if we had a large-scale quantum computer today, its value would be limited. For this reason, the ongoing development of novel algorithms is incredibly important.</p> <h3 id="from-algorithm-to-software"> <a href="#from-algorithm-to-software" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="from-algorithm-to-software"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> From algorithm to software </h3> <p>In the end, simply finding the ‘recipe’ itself is not enough: the algorithm has to be turned into <strong>software</strong>, a piece of language that tells a computer explicitly how to execute the step-by-step instructions.</p> <p>The difference between ‘algorithms’ and ‘software’ is subtle. An algorithm is a purely mathematical description that describes precisely how numbers should be manipulated. It could tell which two numbers must be multiplied, what function must be evaluated, or how an image must be transformed. However, different computers can use different types of processors and memory, and an algorithm does not describe how these operations are done <em>on a specific computer.</em> This is where software comes into play: it describes precisely what computer instructions must be called, where each number is stored in memory, and how an image is represented in binary.</p> <p>As an analogy, you may think of the algorithm as a recipe to bake the perfect chocolate cookie. The algorithm should unambiguously describe what should happen to the ingredients: in what order they should be mixed, how long they should be heated, etcetera. However, to build a factory that produces these cookies, you need to be even more specific: Where is the sugar stored? Out of what pipe does the dough flow? How are cookies laid next to each other in the oven?</p> <p>Fundamentally, core scientific breakthroughs come from finding new algorithms. Once a new algorithm is found, it can be re-used many different times on any capable machine (assuming a good software developer will turn it into appropriate code!).</p> <p>In this book, we care less about quantum software and more about quantum algorithms. Firstly, the algorithms tell us precisely the functionality that quantum computers can offer. Moreover, we don’t yet know how a mature quantum computer will be programmed or how quantum hardware and software will change in the following years. On the other hand, newfound algorithms can be cherished forever.</p> <p>Now that we have come to appreciate algorithms, it is natural to ask <em>which</em> quantum algorithms we know of. What problems do quantum computers solve well? And how do these algorithms compare to their classical equivalents? This will be the topic of the next chapter.</p> <h3 id="further-reading"> <a href="#further-reading" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="further-reading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Further reading </h3> <ul> <li> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UlxHPIEVqA">The Map of Quantum Computing (Youtube)</a>  – A 30-minute video that forms a great supplement to this book. </p> </li> <li> <p>Chris Ferrie’s book <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15838">‘What You Shouldn’t Know About Quantum Computers’</a> debunks several myths about quantum computers, presented in a very accessible way.</p> </li> <li> <p>Are you looking for a much more extensive source that covers pretty much everything there is to know about quantum computers?
