mechanics to understand the <em>functionality</em> of quantum computers.</p> <p>But if you insist: quantum mechanics describes the behaviour of the smallest particles. It leads to many counter-intuitive phenomena: computer memory can store multiple pieces of data at the same time, but upon measurement, nature selects just a single piece (and throws away all the others).</p> </fieldset> <p>If you want to drive a car, do you need to understand how its engine works? Of course you don’t! In a similar vein, you don’t need to know the details of quantum physics to read the rest of this book. So feel free to skip this chapter.</p> <p>Nevertheless, I know that most people <em>want</em> to have some conceptual intuition about what quantum mechanics really is. It is not natural to leave one of the most used word in this book as an abstract concept, and it might be hard for the human brain to proceed without at least seeing some examples.</p> <p>Here is my best attempt to explain quantum mechanics in accessible terms. Proceed with caution, as things will surely get confusing from here.</p> <h3 id="what-is-quantum"> <a href="#what-is-quantum" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="what-is-quantum"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> What is quantum?   </h3> <p><strong>Quantum physics</strong> or <strong>quantum mechanics</strong> is the theory that describes the tiniest particles, like electrons, atoms, and sometimes even small molecules. They are the laws of nature that dictate cause and effect at the scale of nanometers. You may contrast it to Newton’s classical physics, which works great for objects the size of a building or football but becomes inaccurate at much smaller scales. Quantum is, in a sense, a <em>refinement </em>of classical physics: the theories are effectively identical when applied to a coffee mug, but one requires the more difficult quantum theory to describe very small things. </p> <p>Some examples of systems where quantum could play a role are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Atoms and the electrons that orbit around them.</p> </li> <li> <p>Flows of electricity in microscopic (nano-scale) wires and chips</p> </li> <li> <p>Photons, the particles out of which ‘light’ is made.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src="/media/image2.png" style="width:6.26736in;height:0.65625in" alt="A magnifying glass over a circuit board Description automatically generated" />First, we need some physics jargon. The <strong>state</strong> of the world is a complete description of everything there is to know about its contents: all the particles inside it, their velocities, how much they rotate, etcetera. Usually, the entire universe is too big to study, so we often simplify our ‘world’ to just a single isolated particle, or to a limited piece of computer memory. For example, for our prototypical particle, we imagine we’re only interested in its location, which we’ll call $x$ (and we forget about any other structure in the world). In the spirit of computing, we might look at a ‘bit’ that stores information. You may think of it as a tiny magnet that can either point ‘up’ (0) or ‘down’ (1). Note that a state is valid for just one instant, as there could be reasons for it to change as time flows.</p> <p><img src="/media/image3.png" style="width:6.12264in;height:1.95658in" /></p> <h3 id="four-surprising-phenomena-in-the-quantum-world"> <a href="#four-surprising-phenomena-in-the-quantum-world" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="four-surprising-phenomena-in-the-quantum-world"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Four surprising phenomena in the quantum world </h3> <p>The most iconic quantum phenomenon is <strong>superposition.</strong> Think about any property that we can (classically) measure, such as the position of a particle, or the value of a bit on a hard drive (0 or 1). In quantum mechanics, the state of the world can be such that several conflicting measurement outcomes are ‘true’ at the same time: a particle can be at multiple positions at once, or a bit could be 0 and 1 simultaneously.</p> <p>How can you possibly describe a state like that? Well, if we look at just a single particle, the state should contain a long list of all possible positions: to what extent is it at position x=0, to what extent at position x=1, and so forth, for every possible location that the particle can be at. And indeed, this list could be infinite!</p> <p>For the case of a bit, we’d need just two numbers denoting the extent to which it is ‘0’ or ‘1’. To make things even more confusing, these numbers can be negative (and for math experts, they can even be complex numbers). Because we will talk about quantum-mechanical bits a lot, we will give them a shorter name: <strong>qubits.</strong> If we have a bunch of qubits together, we’ll call it a quantum memory.</p> <p>To throw in some more examples, an electron can move at a velocity of 10 m/s and 100 m/s at the same time (which obviously also leads to a superposition in its position). More relevant for us: a quantum memory might use binary notation to store numbers 5 and 11 simultanously, or even 46 different Microsoft Excel spreadsheets at once.</p> <p>More physics-oriented books might call this the <em>particle-wave duality</em>: all particles can also be described as a ‘wave’, which is yet another description of how a particle is spread out over space. The wave is high when a particle is very likely to be there, and small at unlikely locations.</p> <p>The second weird phenomenon is how <strong>quantum measurements</strong> work. Why do we never observe an electron at two places at the same time? Why do I never find my chair both moving and standing still? In quantum mechanics, as soon as we measure the location of a particle, it instantly jumps to just a single location at random. When we measure a qubit, it jumps to either ‘0’ or ‘1’ with some probability. When we measure the data in a quantum memory, we may find any one of the 46 spreadsheets that were stored.</p> <p>This means that the world is intrinsically random (and hence, not deterministic!). But this doesn’t imply that we cannot understand it. We can calculate the <em>probabilities</em> of measurement outcomes with incredible precision as long as we know the state before the measurement.</p> <p>It is important to note that we cannot learn anything about the world without measuring – it is our only way to obtain data from the world, and any process that extracts data must involve a measurement. However, measurements are destructive in the sense that they change the state of the world. In fact, they delete all the rich data encoded in a superposition! If a particle was initially at position x=0, x=3 and x=10, all simultaneously, then upon measurement, it jumps to one of these three options. In jargon, we call this instantaneous change a ‘collapse’. From then onwards, it is 100% at a fixed location: if we measure x=3, then from then onwards, it is located uniquely at x=3 until some other force starts acting on it. This means that, during a quantum computation, we should be cautious about the timing of our measurements – we cannot just peek at the data at any moment we like, or we risk disturbing a superposition.</p> <p>Importantly, this also means that a single piece of quantum memory cannot store an immense number of spreadsheets at the same time – at least, you wouldn’t be able to retrieve each of them. To store 15 MB worth of classical data, we need 15 MB worth of ‘qubits’. Hence, quantum computers are not particularly useful for storing classical data.</p> <p>The fact that a ‘measurement’ changes the state of the world poses a serious problem when engineering a quantum computer. No matter what material we construct our qubits from, they will surely ‘interact’ with other nearby particles, and some of these interactions could be destructive measurements. We call this effect <strong>decoherence</strong>, and we will later see that this forms one of the core challenges to building large and accurate quantum computers.</p> <p>At this point, quantum data doesn’t seem particularly useful. Why would we want to deal with superpositions if they lead to all this uncertainty? Intuitively, think about the advantage of a quantum computer in this way: what if we can jump between specific superposition states to reach our goal (the correct answer) in very few steps, exploiting states that a classical computer could never reach?</p> <p>This is precisely what <strong>quantum operations</strong> do. These are physical forces that change the state of a particle or a quantum memory. They can turn a classical-looking state into a quantum superposition or vice versa. They can act like logical operations, such as AND and OR, but also like new quantum ‘logic’ that has no classical counterpart. Unlike measurements, quantum operations are deterministic: they change quantum states in a precisely defined way. In this book, we mainly deal with operations that work on qubits. We will call such operations <strong>quantum gates</strong> or simply ‘gates’<strong>.</strong></p> <p>A quantum gate takes one or more qubits as input, changes their internal state, and then outputs the same number of qubits (with their altered states). In other words, the number of physical objects remains unchanged, but their quantum states change. As an example, you may think of our prototypical magnet that was initially pointing ‘up’, but a quantum gate might flip this to ‘down’. Because there are many possible quantum gates, each having a different effect on their input, we like to give them names in capital letters, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate">X, Z, H, and CNOT</a>.</p> <p><img src="/media/image4.png" style="width:2.6761in;height:1.04717in" /></p> <p>In the same jargon as the ‘quantum waves’, we can see quantum operations as manipulating these waves. This leads to effects similar to when you throw two stones in a pond, and look at how the resulting waves meet: when the peeks of two waves are at the same location, the water heights will add up. We call this constructive interference. But waves can also have ‘negative’ heights, where the water is lower than normal. Such parts may cancel an incoming peak: destructive interference.<br /> Quantum gates will have similar effects on a qubit’s quantum state, as negative and positive property assignments can interfere destrictively or constructively.</p> <p>The canonical way to describe a quantum computer program is by defining a sequence of quantum gates, one after the other, each of which could act on a different set of qubits. At the end of the computation, we measure all qubits. Below, an example of such a sequence is given, using the standard Quantum Assembly (QASM) language.</p> <p><img src="/media/image5.png" style="width:4.48113in;height:2.0818in" /></p> <p>Together, these steps can be graphically displayed in a <strong>quantum circuit</strong>, as shown here on the right. Quantum circuits represent each qubit with a horizontal line and indicate time flowing from left to right. Whenever a box with a letter is displayed over a qubit line, then the corresponding gate should be applied. This isn’t quite unlike the way we read sheet music!</p> <p>Note that when we run a circuit on an actual quantum computer, the final measurements lead to probabilistic outcomes. We get to see a bunch of ones and zeroes: one classical bit for each qubit. If the circuit was a ‘good’ quantum algorithm, then with high probability, these classical bits will tell us the answer we were looking for. But even then, we might need to redo the computation a few times and take (for example) the most common result as our final answer.</p> <p>If you are completely confused at this point, you are not alone. The whole business of quantum superposition and quantum operations is incredibly complex and is not something you could possibly master after reading four pages. Even after studying the subject for many years, you will encounter paradoxes and counter-intuitive phenomena. On the other hand, I hope that the <em>functionality</em> of quantum circuits makes a lot of sense: we define a list of instructions, and we employ machines that execute these instructions in a well-defined way. This should be an example of how we can operate a quantum device without understanding what’s going on under the hood.</p> <p>There is one more quantum phenomenon to cover – one that comes with a mysterious flair around itself. We’re talking about quantum <strong>entanglement.</strong></p> <p>Imagine that we have two qubits, which we can transport independently from each other without disturbing the data they store (in other words, they remain in the same quantum state). According to quantum mechanics, this pair of qubits may be simultaneously 00 and 11. Now, imagine that computer scientist Alice grabs one of the qubits, takes it on her rocket ship, and flies it all the way to dwarf planet Pluto. The other qubit remains on Earth, in the hands of physicist Bob. Upon arriving on Pluto, Alice measures her qubit and finds outcome ‘1’. A deep question is: what do we now know about the other qubit?</p> <p>Since the possible measurement outcomes were 00 and 11, the other can only be measured as ‘1’ from now onwards. It essentially collapses to be 100% in the state ‘1’. But how could the earth-based qubit possibly <em>know</em> that a measurement occurred on Pluto? According to Einstein’s theory of relativity, information cannot travel faster than the speed of light, which translates into a few hours between Earth and Pluto. Nevertheless, measuring the qubit on earth will always give a consistent result, even when done within the hour.</p> <p>This paradox shows once again how confusing quantum mechanics can be. However, the story above is perfectly consistent with both quantum mechanics and relativity. The core principle is that <em>no information can be sent faster than light between Alice and Bob</em>. For example, can you see why Bob has no way of detecting when Alice reached Pluto just by looking at his entangled qubit? In the most common interpretation of quantum mechanics, the Earth qubit does indeed change its state instantaneously when Alice measures, although there is no way to exploit this effect.</p> <p>There’s a fascinating further discussion about the philosophy behind entanglement, but we’ll leave that to other sources. What matters to us is that distant qubits can still share specific properties that would be impossible classically, leading to new functionalities we can exploit. We will discover what these functionalities are in the chapter on quantum networks.</p> <p>So there you have it: four surprising phenomena you may hear frequently in quantum technology conversations. To summarise:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Superposition: the phenomenon where a qubit is both 0 and 1 at the same time.</p> </li> <li> <p>Quantum measurement: measuring a quantum memory destroys superposition. The result we obtain is probabilistic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Quantum operations/gates: deterministic changes to the state of qubits, which generalise classical logic gates like OR, AND, NOT. A list of several quantum gates forms a quantum circuit.</p> </li> <li> <p>Entanglement: Qubits separated over a long distance can still share unique properties.</p> </li> </ul> <p>If you’d like to know more about the physics and math behind qubits, we recommend the following sources:</p> <ul> <li> <p><a href="http://new.quantum.country/">Quantum Country</a> – a great online textbook about Quantum Computing by Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen.</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://www.qutube.nl/">QuTech Academy’s </a><em><u>School of Quantum</u> – </em>A broad range of topics explained using short videos. </p> </li> </ul> </main> </div> </div> <div class="search-overlay"></div> </div> </body> </html>
