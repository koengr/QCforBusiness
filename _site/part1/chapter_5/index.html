Moreover, a relevant quantum computer won’t just appear from one day to another: there’s a continuous evolution where these devices will become increasingly capable. In this chapter, we will show how we can make a rough prediction about future timelines, and what will happen on the path towards large-scale quantum computation.</p> <p>As a small disclaimer, this chapter is very subjective: it’s not hard to arrive at different conclusions simply by choosing different sources and making different assumptions. I did my utmost best to rely on the most up-to-date information, combining the fiews of the most widely accepted papers and making assumptions that are in line with the view of most experts.</p> <p>Since I published the first estimates in 2022, I’ve seen this approach becoming increasingly popular, with the same images presented at conferences and Google selecting snippets from this text on certain search queries. Hence, I have good faith that the views presented here are among the best that we can do!</p> <p>We will often refer to the goal of having a quantum computer that outperforms a classical computer on a useful task (by being faster, more accurate, or incurring lower costs). In this chapter, we’ll use the word ‘<strong>utility’</strong> to refer to this concept.</p> <p>###</p> <h3 id="what-parameters-are-relevant"> <a href="#what-parameters-are-relevant" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="what-parameters-are-relevant"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> What parameters are relevant? </h3> <p>Compared to currently available technology, we’d require a fundamental improvement to these specifications:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Number of qubits</strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Accuracy of elementary operations (gates)</strong>. This means that quantum computers have the ability to perform long computations without making mistakes.</p> </li> </ul> <p>There are quite a few other parameters that matter (such as the <strong>connectivity</strong>, the <strong>available set of gates</strong>, the <strong>speed of operations</strong>, and so forth). In this chapter, we choose to simplify matters by assuming that all of these other parameters are not a bottleneck, allowing us to focus only on the number of qubits and gate accuracies.</p> <h4 id="balancing-qubits-and-accuracies"> <a href="#balancing-qubits-and-accuracies" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="balancing-qubits-and-accuracies"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Balancing qubits and accuracies </h4> <p>In the previous chapter, we learned that error correction allows us to sacrifice some fraction of qubits in exchange for better accuracies. In fact, we expect that this will be a necessity when performing billions of computational steps! Current estimates suggest that, for early applications, we’ll use around a hundred to a few thousand physical qubits for each logical qubit.</p> <p>For error correction to work, we need to make some assumptions. Several studies assume that the bare physical qubits in a quantum computer will have gate fidelities of roughly 99.99%, which intuitively means that an error occurs roughly every 10.000 steps. As of 2024, the largest quantum computers hit roughly 99.90% fidelity. We still need to reduce errors by roughly a factor of 10, but I think it’s reasonable to assume that this can be accomplished.</p> <p>If we’re willing to assume 99.99% gate fidelities <em>and</em> functioning error correction, then we can simplify our analysis even further. Depending on the computational problem to be solved, we can estimate the maximum <em>logical</em> error rates that we can tolerate, and bump up the number of qubits until that error rate has been reached. In other words, the only remaining parameter will be the number of qubits, making the resource estimates a lot easier.</p> <p>This leads to an interesting situation. For more complex problems, we’ll need more qubits both to store a larger amount of data and to reduce the probability of errors so that the computation can run longer.</p> <p>Isn’t the focus on just qubits a bit short-sighted? Doesn’t this create a perverse incentive for manufacturers to focus only on qubit numbers, forgetting about all the other parameters? Well, I would indeed be worried that some companies can make headlines with unusable computers that happen to have a record qubit number. But luckily, most manufacturers seem dedicated to making the most ‘useful’ computer, and customers will surely judge their products by the capabilities of their logical qubits. We’re obviously making a coarse simplification here, but making predictions about the future is hard enough as it is.</p> <p>Back to the main question: When can we expect a large quantum computer? Now that we’re only counting qubits, we can break our billion-dollar question into two parts:</p> <ul> <li> <p>How many qubits do we need for relevant applications?</p> </li> <li> <p>How long will it take before we have that many qubits?</p> </li> </ul> <details> <summary>Wait! What exactly is this 'accuracy'?</summary> <p>The relevance of <strong>accuracy </strong>is often overlooked, perhaps because this hardly plays a role for classical computers (which operate perfectly for basically all intents and purposes). The problem is as follows: every gate we perform on the quantum computer has a small chance of introducing an error. <strong>The more steps a computation takes, the larger the chance that the computation fails</strong>. In other words: harder problems put more stringent requirements on the quantum computer’s hardware, and require more accurate operations.</p> <p>Of course, our main focus is on massive-scale computational problems that take hours or even weeks on classical machines. </p> <p>To illustrate, imagine a quantum computer where each elementary step (“gate”) has a 1:1000 chance to introduce an error. This computer may suffice for computations of merely 100 gates, but as soon as of the order of 1000 or more gates are needed, the probability that the computer’s output is incorrect becomes quite significant.</p> <p>What if we need to run a circuit of 1 million gates? If the computer has sufficiently many qubits, we will use error correction to lower the probability of error to much less than one-in-a-million.</p> <p>We often state the ‘error’ of a gate, rather than the ‘accuracy’. For example, a gate with 1% chance of error can be said to have 99% ‘accuracy’. Scientists like to define these numbers more precise by talking about <a href="https://www.quantum.amsterdam/part-5-when-can-we-expect-a-useful-quantum-computer-a-closer-look-at-timelines/quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/13198/what-does-quantum-gate-fidelity-mean">gate fidelities</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence">coherence times</a>.</p> <p>Luckily, there is a well-established field of <strong>quantum error correction. </strong>It allows us to combine many <strong>‘physical qubits’</strong> available on the device (think of the order of 1000) into a single, more accurate <strong>‘logical qubit’</strong>, on which gates have a smaller chance of error (say, by a factor 1 billion). This allows much longer computations. <strong>Error correction allows a trade-off between the number of available qubits and gate accuracy.</strong></p> <p>For more details, <a href="https://www.quantum.amsterdam/part-9-why-we-need-error-correction/">see the chapter on error correction</a>. </p> </details> <h3 id="how-many-qubits-are-needed"> <a href="#how-many-qubits-are-needed" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="how-many-qubits-are-needed"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> How many qubits are needed? </h3> <p>In a previous chapter, we discussed the three main applications of quantum computers: quantum simulation, breaking cryptography, and optimisation.</p> <p>The most concrete numbers can be given for <strong>Shor’s algorithm </strong>(breaking cryptography), where we have a very clear problem to tackle: obtain a private (secret) key from a widely-used cryptosystem, like the RSA-2048 protocol. This is the perfect benchmark because there can be no discussion about whether the problem is solved: one either obtains the correct key, or one doesn’t. Moreover, we’re quite convinced that even the best classical computers can’t solve the problem (or else you shouldn’t use internet banking or trust software updates). </p> <p>A <a href="https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-04-15-433/">recent estimate</a> finds that a plausible quantum computer would require roughly <strong>20 million</strong> ‘reasonably good’ physical qubits to factor a 2048-bit number. The whole computation would take about 8 hours<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Such estimates require several assumptions on what a quantum computer would look like in the future. In this case, the authors assume qubits are built using superconducting circuits, which are laid out in a square grid. Error correction is assumed to be done using the so-called surface code, assuming the best-known methods for error correction in 2020. Note that future breakthroughs could reduce the required time and number of qubits even further.</p> <p>For <strong>chemistry and material simulation</strong>, it’s a lot harder to give estimates, because there is not just a single problem to tackle here: one typically uses computers to gradually improve our understanding of a complex structure or chemical reaction. This should be combined with theoretical reasoning and practical experiments. Moreover, classical computers are often able to perform the same computations that the quantum computer would make, at the cost of making certain assumptions or simplifications. There’s a fuzzy region between ‘classically tractable’ and ‘quantum advantage’.</p> <p>The most concrete task is to compute the energy of certain molecular configurations. The benchmark is to provide energies more accurately than done in conventional experiments: one canonically takes the ‘chemical accuracy’ of roughly 1 kcal/mol as the precision to beat. Then, of course, we should focus on molecules where classical computers cannot already achieve such accuracies.   </p> <p>Note that the accuracy of a chemical energy should not be confused with the accuracy of a quantum gate, which is a whole different number.</p> <p>A highly promising and well-studied benchmark problem is the simulation of the so-called FeMo cofactor, in short: FeMoco. This molecule is relevant when bacteria produce Ammonia (NH3), a compound that is of great relevance to a plant’s root system. A better understanding of this process could help us reduce the <a href="https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/fertilizer-and-climate-change">ridiculously large carbon emissions</a> now associated with the production of artificial fertilizer. We give more details in a separate chapter. </p> <p>Simulating FeMoco is believed <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.030305">to require around <strong>4 million qubits</strong></a> (and around 4 days of computation for a single simulation run). The assumptions of the hardware and error correction are similar to those of Shor’s algorithm: the estimate is based on a square grid of superconducting qubits, using surface code to correct errors.</p> <p>For a different enzyme, namely cytochrome P450, it <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2203533119">has been estimated that around <strong>5 million</strong> qubits are needed</a> (again taking roughly 4 days of computation). Altogether, we conclude that a couple million qubits (of sufficiently high quality) can make quantum computers relevant for R&amp;D in chemistry. </p> <p>Some tasks that are mainly of interest for scientific purposes, such as simulating models of quantum magnets, can be achieved with fewer resources. Under similar assumptions, simulating a 2D transverse field Ising model is estimated to take <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07629">just under 1 million qubits</a>.</p> <p>For many <strong>optimization problems</strong>, it’s practically impossible to give reasonable estimates. For one, a true killer algorithm for optimization problems is not known yet. The algorithms that are presented as the most promising are often <em>heuristic, </em>meaning that scientists do not know how long an algorithm will take to find solutions. This can happen, for example, when an algorithm repeats a certain loop until a stopping criterion has been met.</p> <p>This may come as a shock, considering the many news items that report how quantum computers may already <a href="https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/stories/2019/11/where-is-the-electron-and-how-many-of-them.html">solve</a> practical <a href="https://thequantumdaily.com/2021/11/01/jp-morgan-chase-bank-research-team-bring-portfolio-optimization-a-step-closer-in-nisq-era/">problems</a>. But don’t be fooled: these articles state that quantum computers <em>can</em> indeed solve relatively simple problems, but often fail to mention that there exist <em>different </em>approaches by which classical computers can solve the same problems much, much faster. </p> <p>Many optimization problems have a plethora of potential solutions, but the goal is to find the <em>optimal</em> solution (say, the one that incurs the least costs or gets you to your destination the fastest). The solution space is often so large that we don’t even know if we hit the optimal solution, but we’re okay with finding one that’s <em>pretty close. </em>Several papers claim that a quantum computer already finds solutions <em>faster</em>, but in all cases, worrying sacrifices were made for the optimality of the solutions.</p> <p>One of the leading sources of wild claims is D-Wave’s quantum annealer. This is a ‘limited’ quantum computer that cannot run every quantum algorithm, but it’s extremely good at one specific algorithm called “quantum annealing”. With around 5000 qubits, it can handle reasonably large problems, and several companies have tried their hands at this machine. The results obtained through today’s quantum annealing approaches are likely also achieved by putting a similar amount of effort into a good classical method.</p> <p>We can summarize our conclusions in the table below.</p> <div class="table-wrapper"><table> <thead> <tr> <th><strong>Application</strong></th> <th><strong>How well can we estimate qubit requirements?</strong></th> <th><strong>Use case example</strong></th> <th><strong>Qubits needed?</strong></th> <th><strong>Gate error assumed?</strong></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Breaking cryptography</td> <td>Good</td> <td>Cracking RSA-2048</td> <td>~ 20 million</td> <td>~ 0.1%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Chemistry</td> <td>Reasonable</td> <td>Simulation of FeMoco</td> <td>~ 4 million</td> <td>~ 0.1%</td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Simulation of P450</td> <td>~ 5 million</td> <td>~ 0.1 %</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Optimization / AI</td> <td>Bad</td> <td>?</td> <td>?</td> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p>Figure 1: The electrons around an atom are generally in a superposition over an infinite number of locations.

On the other hand, it’s impossible to estimate by how much. Will we reduce qubit requirements by a few per cent? Or by a factor of ten? By a factor of one thousand?</p> <p>Some sources actually try to extrapolate the reduction in required qubits over time (like Youtube science educator Veritasium<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and a report by McKinsey<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>), but this is such a wonky linky line over incrompehensive scales that we will follow this strategy.</p> <p>We observe that, in error correction techniques alone, there appears to be steady progress to improve methodologies (see the chapter on challenges in hardware). These can lower the number of physical qubits needed, and set a lower bar for other parameters (like gate accuracies or connectivity). Based on discussions with scientists, lowering the qubit requirements by a factor of 3 to 10 seems plausible. Hence, for optimistic readers, we can set another target at around 400.000 qubits (which seems at a similar scale as early simulations for theoretical physics models).</p> <div class="table-wrapper"><table> <thead> <tr> <th><strong>Application</strong></th> <th><strong>How well can we estimate qubit requirements?</strong></th> <th><strong>Use case example</strong></th> <th><strong>Qubits needed?</strong></th> <th><strong>Gate error assumed?</strong></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Chemistry (Optimistic)</td> <td>Reasonable</td> <td>Simulation of FeMoco (with 10x improved methods)</td> <td>~ 400.000</td> <td>~ 0.1 %</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Science</td> <td>Reasonable</td> <td>2D Transverse field Ising model</td> <td>~ 900.000</td> <td>~ 0.1 %</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p>Figure 2: News header by Techradar.

An important question is: can we already achieve any utility with such noisy devices before we achieve large-scale error correction? That is one of the most disputed topics in our field, and therefore it deserves some attention.</p> <p>There seems to be a large effort from startups and enterprises to cook up applications with a convincing advantage, even on noisy devices. This noble effort would massively increase the overall usefulness of quantum computers. So far, their findings have convinced some experts, but most remain extremely sceptical about NISQ utility.</p> <p>Maryland-based professor Sankar Das Darma underlines this picture in his opinion article “Quantum computing has a hype problem”.<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> He states about NISQ that “the commercialization potential is far from clear”, pointing at the unsatisfying evidence behind several claims in finance, machine learning and drug discovery.</p> <p>Several consultants made ridiculous claims about how tiny machines would see an exponential advantage over enormous supercomputers. Now that the field is coming of age, many are becoming more careful. To illustrate, when looking back at a 2021 report, BCG chivalrously admits<sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Our assumptions for near-term value creation in the NISQ era, however, have proved optimistic and must be revised.”</p> </blockquote> <p>The most serious claim about NISQ utility comes from a Nature publication by the IBM team, in a paper called “Evidence for the utility of quantum computing before fault tolerance”.<sup id="fnref:13" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> However, their arguments were quickly refuted by further studies that simulated IBM’s impressive quantum experiment on a conventional laptop.<sup id="fnref:14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p> <p>Most experts seem to keep an eye on NISQ applications but will agree that no utility for NISQ machines has been found yet. An overview article about <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02411-5">pharmaceutical applications</a><sup id="fnref:15" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> has a careful yet suggestive message:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Most NISQ algorithms […] rely heavily on classical optimization heuristics, and the actual run time is difficult to estimate. Furthermore, recent results suggest that in NISQ approaches, the number of measurements required to achieve a given error scales exponentially with the depth of the circuit. For these reasons, here we focus our discussion exclusively on fault-tolerant quantum computers.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Similarly, a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00803">recent</a> overview<sup id="fnref:16" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> of quantum chemistry seems to remain agnostic with regards to NISQ advantage while pointing out that fault-tolerance has a higher chance of succeeding.</p> <blockquote> <p>“… it is difficult to predict when or if algorithms on near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices will outperform classical computers for useful tasks. But it is likely that, at some point, the achievement of large-scale quantum error correction will enable the deployment of a host of so-called error-corrected quantum algorithms”</p> </blockquote> <p>In this book, we follow the view of most authorities in the field by playing it safe and sticking to the well-understood use cases for early fault-tolerant quantum computers that we discussed previously. We can not rule out new breakthroughs that allow NISQ utility, but we’re unwilling to gamble that they will happen. Any such breakthrough could completely stir up our fragile prediction – but so would unexpected backlashes in hardware development or even unforeseen funding stops.</p> <p>###</p> <h3 id="how-long-until-we-have-million-qubit-machines"> <a href="#how-long-until-we-have-million-qubit-machines" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="how-long-until-we-have-million-qubit-machines"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> How long until we have million-qubit machines? </h3> <p>Now that we’ve set our target to roughly a million qubits, we’d like to estimate when such hardware will be available. We highlight the following sources:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Road maps and claims of hardware manufacturers</p> </li> <li> <p>Surveys to experts</p> </li> <li> <p>Extrapolation of Moore’s law</p> </li> </ol> <h4 id="what-do-manufacturers-say"> <a href="#what-do-manufacturers-say" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="what-do-manufacturers-say"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> What do manufacturers say? </h4> <p>Below, we see the qubit numbers that several manufacturers have already realized (solid disks) and what they will produce in the future according to their public road maps (opaque plusses). Note that the vertical axis is logarithmic, so it displays a very broad range from ~10 to ~10.000 qubits. A lower number of qubits does by no means indicate that these computers are worse. In fact, the machines with the lower numbers of qubits on this graph happen to have an important edge in other parameters, such as gate accuracies and qubit connectivity.</p> <p><img src=" /media/image14.png" style="width:4.22469in" /></p> <p>Next to their road maps, companies sometimes make more daring claims in media interviews or at presentations at large events. Based on the application targets above, it should be no surprise that manufacturers shoot for around a million qubits as a ‘moonshot’ accomplishment. Back in 2020, IBM claimed to reach the 1 million qubit target by 2030<sup id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote" rel="footnote">10</a></sup>. Around the same time, Google was interpreted by journalists to do this even faster (around 2029<sup id="fnref:18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote" rel="footnote">11</a></sup>). The start-up PsiQuantum, which made waves thanks to record-high investments of over a billion dollars for their photonic quantum chips, went as far as claiming to have a million qubits by 2025<sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote">12</a></sup>.</p> <p>It seems that these claims were a bit too ambitious. In 2024, with only a year to go and no publicly presented product progression whatsoever, PsiQuantum shifted its 1 million qubit road map to 2027<sup id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote" rel="footnote">13</a></sup>. IBM took an even more conservative step, where it’s now claiming to have just 100.000 qubits in 2033<sup id="fnref:21" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote" rel="footnote">14</a></sup> (although this machine should meet the error correction features that we dreamingly assumed in the previous sections). Although this delay sounds disappointing, hardware manufacturers are still making impressive progress, as the number of qubits grows faster than one would predict according to Moore’s Law for classical chips!</p> <p>Companies working on trapped ion machines tend to have fewer qubits, but higher gate accuracies. Perhaps this is why <a href="https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap">IonQ</a> displays its road map in a different format: they aim to have 1024 so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_volume">algorithmic qubits</a> by 2028<sup id="fnref:22" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote" rel="footnote">15</a></sup>. This means that IonQ will have <em>at least </em>this number of qubits, but also guarantees sufficient gate accuracy to be able to run reasonably long circuits. It’s unclear whether a simple form of error correction may be needed to achieve this. If so, the actual number of physical qubits may be some orders of magnitude higher. <a href="https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/news/2020/10/get-to-know-honeywell-s-latest-quantum-computer-system-model-h1">Quantinuum</a> (previously working under the name Honeywell) makes less concrete predictions but expects fault-tolerant computing by 2030<sup id="fnref:23" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote" rel="footnote">16</a></sup> (meaning that significant error correction is in place).</p> <h4 id="what-does-moores-law-say"> <a href="#what-does-moores-law-say" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="what-does-moores-law-say"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> What does Moore’s law say? </h4> <p>One could assume that quantum computers will ‘grow’ at a similar rate as classical computers. Moore’s law states that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit grows exponentially: the number doubles roughly every two years. This has been a surprisingly accurate predictor for the development of classical IT. If we apply Moore’s law to quantum, to get from one thousand to one million would take around 20 years – predicting that the million-qubit mark won’t be passed until 2044. Clearly, most hardware manufacturers are more optimistic. If we assume the number of qubits doubles each year, one would predict that 1-million-qubit machines will be available in ten years. While doubling a quantum computer’s size each year is already a daunting challenge, companies like IBM and Pasqal and QuEra set the bar even higher for themselves, hoping to double every 7-9 months.</p> <h4 id="what-do-experts-say"> <a href="#what-do-experts-say" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="what-do-experts-say"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> What do experts say? </h4> <p>The Global Risk Institute conducts yearly surveys asking experts to state the <em>likelihood</em> that quantum computers pose a significant threat to public-key cryptography 5 years from now. Similarly, respondents would also estimate the likeliness 10, 15, 20, and 30 years away.</p> <p>This essentially boils down to the question<em>: when will a quantum computer run Shor’s algorithm to crack RSA-2048?</em> We previously saw that around 20 million qubits would be needed for this (although experts may take into account that this number can still be reduced).</p> <p>We consider this an important source because many important authorities in the field (like professors and corporate leaders) take part in this study. The results from December 2023<sup id="fnref:24" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote" rel="footnote">17</a></sup>, gathered from 37 participants, are displayed below.</p> <p><img src=" /media/image15.png" style="width:5.27992in" alt="threat timeline expert estimates" /></p> <details> <summary>**How to read this graph?**</summary> <p>Let’s look at the column labeled ‘5 years’. A total of 24 correspondents indicate that there is less than 1% chance that quantum computers pose a security threat in the next five years. A single person is quite pessimistic and assigns &gt;70% chance that this will happen. On average, experts say that there’s a fairly small chance that quantum computers will pose a threat to cryptography in the next 5 years. </p> <p>Further to the right, the ratios shift: looking at 20 years from now, the majority of experts believe that quantum computers pose a serious threat: over half of them assign a likelihood of 70% or more.</p> </details> <p>It appears that the majority of experts believe that the tipping point is between 10-20 years from now. Somewhere between 15 and 20 years away, there’s a point where the median participant assigned roughly 50% chance to see a quantum computer capable of breaking cryptographic codes. However, we should take into account a significant uncertainty: several experts make wildly varying estimates, so there’s no obvious conclusion from this data.</p> <p>These experts are likely aware of hardware manufacturer’s road maps, as we shall see below.</p> <h3 id="putting-it-all-together"> <a href="#putting-it-all-together" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="putting-it-all-together"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Putting it all together </h3> <p>In the infographic below, we present all of our findings in a single graph.</p> <p><img src=" /media/image16.png" style="width:6.26806in" /></p> <p>Assuming that qubit numbers will grow exponentially (and that all other parameters will keep up accordingly), we can consider several scenarios. A pessimistic scenario would be that the number of qubits ‘merely’ follows the classical version of Moore’s Law, and qubit numbers double only once every two years (dotted line). Then, we’d have to wait well past 2040 to even reach 100.000 qubits.</p> <p>An extremely optimistic outlook would follow the blue dashed line (which extrapolates the progress by IBM, doubling their qubits every ~9 months). If one also believes in useful applications with much less than a million qubits, then we may be able to run these around 2030.</p> <p>An intermediate perspective is to assume that the number of qubits doubles annually. Interestingly, this seems to be roughly in line with IBM’s latest claims and the typical expert opinion. Depending on the application, it would mean that quantum chemistry simulation and codebreaking canbe within reach between ~2033 and 2040.</p> <p>To conclude, our estimates strongly depend on the assumptions that you’re willing to accept (who would’ve thought!). Do you believe that improvements in algorithms and error corrections will allow for applications with much less than a million qubits? How quickly do you believe that the hardware will improve? If you force me to make a prediction, I’d say the first applications arise between 2035 and 2040, with the understanding that there’s a huge margin for error.</p> <p>As a final remark, a full utility-scale quantum computer requires much more than a growth in the number of qubits. To reach the first useful applications, we likely require simultaneous progress in algorithmics, software, gate accuracies, error correction techniques, fridges, lasers, and many other important subfields of quantum computing. Hopefully, all these disciplines will find the required breakthroughs that will enable the exponential growth of quantum computing hardware.</p> <p><strong>Further reading:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Scientist Samuel Jaques (Waterloo) makes insightful graphs that combine the number of qubits <em>and</em> the error rates, and puts them in the perspective of what is required for various applications. <a href="https://sam-jaques.appspot.com/quantum_landscape_2023">https://sam-jaques.appspot.com/quantum_landscape_2023</a></li> </ul> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:8" role="doc-endnote"> <p>How to factor 2048 bit RSA integers in 8 hours using 20 million noisy qubits; Craig Gidney, and Martin Ekerå, Quantum 5, 433 (2021), https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-04-15-433/ <a href="#fnref:8" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:9" role="doc-endnote"> <p>See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UrdExQW0cs&amp;t=1024s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UrdExQW0cs&amp;t=1024s</a>, starting at 17:04. <a href="#fnref:9" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:10" role="doc-endnote"> <p>McKinsey Quantum Technology Monitor 2024, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/steady-progress-in-approaching-the-quantum-advantage">https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/steady-progress-in-approaching-the-quantum-advantage</a> <a href="#fnref:10" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:11" role="doc-endnote"> <p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/03/28/1048355/quantum-computing-has-a-hype-problem/">https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/03/28/1048355/quantum-computing-has-a-hype-problem/</a> <a href="#fnref:11" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:12" role="doc-endnote"> <p><a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/long-term-forecast-for-quantum-computing-still-looks-bright">https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/long-term-forecast-for-quantum-computing-still-looks-bright</a> <a href="#fnref:12" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:13" role="doc-endnote"> <p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06096-3">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06096-3</a> <a href="#fnref:13" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:14" role="doc-endnote"> <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16372">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16372</a> <a href="#fnref:14" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:15" role="doc-endnote"> <p>Santagati, R., Aspuru-Guzik, A., Babbush, R. et al.
