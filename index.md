This free book contains everything you should know about quantum
computers, without going into tedious technical details. It answers questions such as:

- What are the [applications]({% link _essentials/applications-overview.md %}) of quantum computers and quantum networks?

- In [what year]({% link _essentials/timelines.md %}) will we have large-scale quantum computers?

- What are the consequences for [cybersecurity]({% link _applications/cybersecurity.md %}) ?

- What [strategic actions]({% link _advanced/strategic-actions.md %}) should organisations take? 

- What is the status of today's [hardware]({% link _advanced/hardware.md %})?
<br>

As the first generation of quantum computers is on the horizon, understanding their impact is more important than ever. Luckily, you don't need a physics degree to understand their functionality - just like you donâ€™t need to know how a transistor works to thrive in conventional IT. 

This book, written by [Koen Groenland](https://www.koengroenland.com), is a gentle and business-oriented introduction to the opportunities and threats of quantum technologies. It equips you with the necessary knowledge to join cutting-edge discussions and to make strategic decisions.
