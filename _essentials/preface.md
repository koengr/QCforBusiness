# Preface: why this book?

*‘Quantum computing will change everything,’ the man in front of me
said. Standing tall and confident, he took another sip of his drink
before continuing, ‘It will be the biggest revolution since the
invention of the transistor. Imagine a world where we can cure any
disease with personalised medicine. A world where new energy sources
will free us from our dependence on fossil fuels. Not to mention that…’*

*‘Well—’ I tried to interrupt, but the man passionately rattled on.*

*‘It will finally enable us to build general Artificial Intelligence
that can take over our tedious everyday jobs, so 95% of our population
no longer has to work!’*

*‘You know that quantum computers are still quite some years away,
right?’, I countered. He leaned in, eyes still gleaming with
excitement.*

*‘That's what most people think. But the reality is, we're closer than
ever. Quantum supremacy has already been achieved. Google did it in
2019; since then, progress has been exponential. Did you see the
presentation by that guy from Goldman Sachs? Their investments already
see higher returns than ever since their new Monte Carlo algorithm.’*

The above conversation captures a feeling that many seasoned experts in
quantum computing will have. A group of enthusiasts presents ‘quantum’
as a revolutionary technology with unprecedented capabilities. Plentiful
reputable sources report how next-generation devices are key in
[tackling climate

[revolutionising
AI](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/05/02/six-ground-breaking-industries-quantum-computing-is-projected-to-revolutionize/),
and building [unhackable
networks](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2368353-an-unhackable-quantum-internet-is-being-built-in-new-york-city/).

Experts who are actually *building* quantum computers are much, much
more reluctant. At an academic conference, you hear a completely
different story. Scientists
[ridicule](https://twitter.com/DulwichQuantum) the absurd claims that
some consultants and startups make. They will point out that the
applications of quantum computers are still very much uncertain and that
we’re still searching for convincing use cases.

The quantum scene seems divided into two distinct worlds. One is the
business world, eager to reach out to anybody who will hear them about
the game-changing capabilities of quantum computers. The other is a more
cautious community of scientists and technical experts who quietly bring
quantum computers to reality, sharing their results in specialised
papers that require a PhD to understand.

I was fascinated by this paradoxical situation. Who is right? How
powerful are these quantum computers really, and how do they compare to
existing technologies? In what year will we have a large-scale quantum
computer, and what will it look like? These are billion-dollar
questions, but the answers will vary wildly, depending on who you ask.

After searching for these answers for a decade, I’ve finally found a
unique position to answer most of these questions. As a former academic
researcher, I acquired a detailed understanding of quantum computers and
their algorithms. For the past four years, I have had the privilege of
forming R&D collaborations with startups, enterprises and
governments while having countless meetings with CEOs, research leads
and policymakers. I’ve seen the perspectives from both worlds and can
cut through dishonest and deceptive claims. Additionally, after training
many new colleagues and setting up professional learning programs, I
developed a good intuition about what newcomers *want* to know about
quantum technology and how to explain it in an accessible way.

However, the decisive factor that led me to write this book is my
discomfort with other sources. Like many others in this field, I’m
unhappy with the many hyped and unbalanced articles that would otherwise
populate the top entries in Google search results (or even the New York
Times [best-selling
books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Supremacy)[^1]). There is a
clear need for a neutral source of information that others can reference
when disagreeing about facts or debunking myths, and I’m very happy that
it’s finally complete.

That doesn’t mean that this book contains only confirmed facts – not at
all! Writing about a computer of the future comes with mountains of
uncertainty. In 2005, nobody could have predicted that a mere five years
ahead, everyone would be playing games and consuming the internet on
their smartphones. In 2015, nobody could have predicted the impact of
Large Language Models like ChatGPT. And indeed, today’s best predictions
of a future quantum revolution won’t be quite so accurate either.

Even worse, experts wildly disagree in several cases. For example, the
usefulness of quantum AI and optimisation is vigorously disputed, and
the rate at which hardware will progress depends on many yet-to-discover
breakthroughs. The best I could do is describe various perspectives on
these matters and highlight the best arguments from both sides.

My colleagues and I had many discussions and disagreements, without
which I wouldn’t have been able to gather the facts and opinions in this
book. And it shouldn’t stop there. I keep welcoming criticism, opinions,
and feedback about these complex topics, aiming to refine these texts
even more in future updates.

Even though much is still uncertain, I think that a reliable indication
of the prospects of quantum computing is more important than ever.
Quantum startups are acquiring huge investments, allowing them to hire
managers, software developers, salesmen, and marketers. Governments need
informed policymakers, and journalists should cover quantum
breakthroughs. Pretty much every organisation that deals with IT will
want to keep a close eye on the impact that ‘quantum’ will have on them.

This book is for precisely these people who don’t need to understand all
the technical details but still need to talk, read, and write about
quantum technologies. We won’t care so much about the underlying math or
physics but rather about the *functionality* of a quantum computer: the
opportunities, the threats, and the concrete actions organisations can
take.

How should you read this book? I chose to split the content into three
parts. The first part contains the essentials that we recommend for
everyone to read. This is an incredibly efficient way to learn all the
background that you need – you should be ready to understand other
sources and have some depth in professional discussions or meetings. To
go into more detail, parts two and three contain more information about
the (software) applications and the (hardware) devices, respectively. A
final fourth part is reserved for additional resources that can be
useful or fun when continuing your quantum journey.
