How will businesses use quantum technology in the future? What problems will a quantum computer solve? How long will it take before these devices become commercially relevant?

With the first generation of quantum computers on the horizon, understanding their impact is more relevant than ever. Luckily, you don't need a physics degree to understand the functionality of these computers â€“ just like you don't need to know how a transistor works to excel in conventional IT. 

This book is the perfect introduction to the opportunities and threats of quantum technologies. It equips you with the necessary knowledge to join cutting-edge discussions and make strategic decisions.  

*Easy to read and full of insights, a must-read for anyone looking to understand the real-world impact of quantum computing.* - **Diederick Croese, Director of Center for Quantum and Society**

*This book offers a well-rounded, scientifically accurate overview of quantum technology, highlighting its significant potential for innovation.* - **Christian Schaffner, Professor in Theoretical Computer Science, Director of QuSoft**
