In the previous chapters, we discussed the [use
cases](https://quantumcomputingforbusiness.com/essentials/applications-overview/),
the [threats](https://quantumcomputingforbusiness.com/applications/cybersecurity/), and
the [timelines](https://quantumcomputingforbusiness.com/essentials/timelines/)
of quantum technologies. We will now look at the strategic perspective
of a typical non-quantum enterprise. We will assume a typical
large-scale organisation that does not sell IT products per se, but
relies heavily on computing infrastructure to optimise its operations,
supervise processes, communicate with suppliers and clients, and
potentially invest in computer-aided R&D. While these organizations may
be excited about the potential of quantum computing, they may also feel
vulnerable—whether due to competitors advancing ahead or due to hackers
attacking legacy cryptography.

The first steps, like growing expertise, finding adequate staff, and
doing first proof-of-concept studies, will be largely
sector-independent. Further steps can become more organisation-specific,
and we will highlight several tools for tailored assessment.

For more bespoke advice beyond this chapter, organisations would
typically resort to specialised consultancies. The larger players have
extensive writings, for example:

- [Capgemini – Quantum technologies: How to prepare your organisation
  for a quantum advantage
  now](https://www.capgemini.com/insights/research-library/quantum-technologies/)

- [McKinsey – Quantum computing use cases are getting real—what you need
  to
  know](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/quantum-computing-use-cases-are-getting-real-what-you-need-to-know)

- [BCG – Quantum Computing Is Becoming Business
  Ready ](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/enterprise-grade-quantum-computing-almost-ready)

We find most of these sources somewhat hyped, emphasizing the risks of
missing out and urging organisations to start whichever quantum project
as soon as possible. Nevertheless, practically all sources (whether
academic, governmental or consultancies) agree on the first strategic
steps that one should take. We break these down into three stages below.

alt="what steps can businesses companies take in quantum professionals guide 1" />

## Common first steps

### Step 1: Start with no-regret moves
{: .no_toc }

Most companies start with early steps aimed at better understanding the
situation. These can be done with very little financial risk.

**Some must-do actions:**

- Appoint a quantum lead or a quantum working group, tasked with
  following the developments.

- Read up and learn. If you’ve come this far in this Guide, you’re
  already doing a fantastic job. We have a separate chapter on further
  [learning
  resources](https://quantumcomputingforbusiness.com/resources/further-reading/).

- Create internal awareness. Many employees will enjoy inspirational
  talks, tours or demonstrations that academics or quantum manufacturers
  can provide.

**Optionally:**

- Put quantum on the agenda with senior management. 

- Involve collaborators, suppliers and vendors, and make your interest
  in quantum known. It is to your benefit if suppliers are
  well-prepared. 

- Participate in a workshop, hackathon, and similar event.

Towards more concrete actions, it makes sense to split your quantum
journey into two different categories:

a\. Preparing for **quantum applications, **where the goal is to
leverage quantum technologies to gain some competitive advantage (for
example, by strengthening your R&D, further optimising your logistics,
improving a product, etc).

b\. Migrating to **quantum-safe cryptography,** where the goal is to
keep your IT secure against attackers with a quantum computer.

These endeavours serve very different purposes and are likely
spearheaded by different departments. Hence, it seems logical to break
these down into separate projects. We discuss further steps in both
directions separately.

## Prepare to use quantum applications

### Step 2a: Explore use-cases
{: .no_toc }

At this stage, most organisations will want to make low-regret moves
that get them prepared to leverage quantum technologies fairly soon
after practical utility becomes available. Some of the bottlenecks could
be the lack of in-house knowledge, a limited available workforce, or a
long timeline to integrate quantum applications in production
environments.

**Must do:**

- Identify the most impactful use cases in your sector.

- Sketch a road map for the coming years. 

**Optional but recommended: **

- Start concrete proof-of-concept projects. Right now, these are
  unlikely to offer practical utility and will likely tackle just a toy
  problem. However, these help build experience in setting up quantum
  projects and discover ‘unknown unknowns’. For example, for staff with
  a strong physics or mathematics background it is relatively accisble
  (and fun!) to get acquainted with quantum [programming
  packages](https://quantumcomputingforbusiness.com/resources/further-reading/#i-want-to-learn-to-program-a-quantum-computer)
  and to implement a first test algorithm.

- Find strategic partners. Organisations can save costs by collaborating
  on early, pre-competitive exploration. 

- Create PR! We notice that many companies are very actively promoting
  their early results on quantum applications, even if these do not
  offer significant advantages yet. 

- Hire staff with a strong background in quantum technologies who
  understand the market, have the right skills to lead proof-of-concept
  studies, and can offer advice for strategic decisions.

### Step 3a: Implementing actual applications, whenever ready
{: .no_toc }

From here onwards, it gets increasingly difficult to give concrete
advice, as priorities may depend on your business and on the way the
field of quantum computing will progress. Several sources will simply
tell you do “develop a long-term strategy” or similar. Others highlight
the need to "remain agile" to quickly adapt to this rapidly evolving
field.

 

For inspiration or a dot on the horizon, you may think towards a
competence centre for quantum computing, similar to how many companies
have special departments for data science and/or AI. It may also be
reasonable to combine these departments. 

### Identifying fruitful use cases
{: .no_toc }

From a top-down perspective, it is a good exercise to identify your
current needs in high-performance computing.** **What do you currently
spend your computing budget on? Are there any areas where new tools in
computation or modelling could provide serious business value (for
example, by being faster, tackling bigger problems, or delivering higher
accuracy)? Which quantities would you ideally have calculated, but are
beyond the reach of current computers? This results in a longlist of use
cases where new computational tools are worth further investigation. The
next step would be to research to what extent a quantum computer (or
whichever other new computational tool) offers any advantage.

We recommend this top-down approach because it can lead to conclusions
sooner, especially because it will identify use cases that are *not*
worth your time (for example, because additional computational power
provides little value).

It is also possible to take a bottom-up approach. Looking at the
available quantum algorithms, which would speed up processes in your
existing IT? Would any of them provide value for your business? This
more technical perspective requires some in-depth quantum expertise but
can definitely be worth the effort, especially if you have people with
the right skills available.

The Quantum Application Lab is a collaboration between various Dutch
research organisations. They invite end-users to explore the benefits of
quantum computers in projects that last anywhere between 3 and 12
months, ranging between a first exploration of use cases to advanced
development of quantum prototype software. Several example projects can
be found on their website:

<summary>What does an R&D collaboration with academia look like?</summary>

Several end-users start collaborations with universities to better
understand the use-cases of quantum computing. This is often a win-win
situation, as companies can learn from renowned experts at relatively
low costs, whereas academics benefit from additional funding and
showcasing that their research has practical interests. Moreover, many
countries provide subsidies for so-called ‘public-private partnerships’.

You will most likely be dealing with a university’s tech transfer office
(TTO), which specializes in making in-house knowledge available
externally. As a first step, it is important to agree on the scope of
the project: what are the research questions, what are the expected
outcomes, how long will the project run, and so forth. Ideally, this
would be a discussion between an expert from your organisation and a
university’s (assistant) professor. The latter can help shape the plan
and may take up a supervising role, as the actual work is often executed
by a junior researcher employed as a PhD candidate or a postdoctoral
(PD) researcher. PhD programs take relatively long, 3-5 years depending
on your locale, and it may take some time before the first results come
in. Postdoc projects often take 1-3 years and can lead to results
sooner.

When the topic and duration of the project are clear, it is important to
discuss details around intellectual property (IP), often done by legal
experts. For universities, it is important that future research can
freely build upon the project's IP. Moreover, they will demand that the
results can be published in academic journals. At the same time, a
paying company will want sufficient options to patent new discoveries
and will require exclusive use of the IP within their sector. These
demands do not necessarily conflict with each other, and in principle,
it should be possible to find an arrangement that satisfies both
parties.  

A straightforward way to ensure that the company learns from the
academic developments is by organising meetings or workshops throughout
the collaboration project, in which the ongoing R&D is discussed with
company staff. Such steps are arguably more important than the final
results, which often take the form of academic papers or business
reports, which risk disappearing in someone's drawer.

## Migrating to post-quantum cryptography

This section relies on technical knowledge from the previous chapter on
[cybersecurity](https://quantumcomputingforbusiness.com/applications/cybersecurity/).

### Step 2b: Prepare your migration 
{: .no_toc }

Cryptography is a completely different beast, with a more concrete goal,
and more urgent timelines for most organisations. Contrary to the
applications in the previous section, the cryptography migration is not
optional. Luckily, most organisations face the same problem, and there
is ample research on effective steps. The core challenge is to upgrade
*all* existing public-key cryptography to Post-Quantum Cryptography
(PQC) in the next decade, which could be spread over hundreds or
thousands of different applications. Many businesses, especially those
dealing with critical infrastructure, may additionally deal with
regulators who may or may not have guidelines ready. Moreover, IT
transitions can be incredibly slow - it is not uncommon to see plans
that cover 5 or even 10 years[^59].

Authorities seem to agree that the following initial steps should be
taken urgently by all large organisations.

- Create awareness: make sure that the quantum threat is well-understood
  in your security departments and among IT managers and product owners
  throughout the organisation.

- Create an inventory of cryptographic assets used within the
  organisation. This should include both software and hardware, and
  should clearly specify the used algorithms, whether developed in-house
  or purchased from a vendor. Some parties refer to a 'cryptographic
  bill of materials' (CBOM).

- Determine the risk and urgency of PQC migration. Most organisations
  already perform regular risk assessments of their IT infrastructure.
  Additionally, organisations should assess whether they classify as an
  urgent adopter of PQC (see below).

- Create a migration plan. This is a more complex step, which should at
  least prioritise which assets must be migrated first and indicate
  whether the migration of all urgent systems can be realistically
  achieved in time, before the arrival of cryptographically relevant
  quantum computers.

For more details, we recommend following the [PQC Migration
Handbook](https://english.aivd.nl/publications/publications/2023/04/04/the-pqc-migration-handbook),
a free guide written by the Dutch secret service AIVD and research
organisations CWI and TNO. Security authorities in other countries have
made similar guidance available.

[^59]: To illustrate, the PQC Migration Handbook mentions that "Judging
    from previous migrations this process might take well over five
    years". The NSA's requirements for national security systems,
    published in 2022, demand that quantum-safe algorithms be
    exclusively used from 2033 onwards.

#### Are you an urgent adopter?
{: .no_toc }

The PQC Migration Handbook distinguishes between regular and urgent
adopters of quantum-safe cryptography. You are an urgent adopter when
you:

- Handle sensitive or personal data with a long confidentiality span.

- Handle critical infrastructure on which large groups of people rely.

- Provide systems with a long lifespan; hence, your products will still
  be around when quantum computers are available.

Based on these criteria, a significant fraction of organisations would
classify as urgent adopters, such as banks, governments, car
manufacturers, grid operators, hospitals, and so forth. Examples of
non-urgent adopters could be schools, webshops, travel agencies, many
construction agencies, etc. Urgent adopters are encouraged to start
their migration as soon as possible if they haven't already.

### Step 3b: Migrate
{: .no_toc }

This is a much more technical step for which you will need a
well-prepared migration plan from the previous step.

Organisations are strongly discouraged from implementing their own
cryptographic functions. The best practice is to rely on standard
libraries written by cryptographic experts, which should be safe against
a broad spectrum of attacks and have seen careful reviews. We expect
NIST's standards to soon be available in popular open-source packages
like OpenSSL or BouncyCastle. This makes the migration less technical,
although organisations still deal with the operational challenge of
updating a huge number of applications within a limited time.

Due to harvest now, decrypt later attacks, most organisations will focus
on updating key exchange algorithms before updating digital signature
methods.

On the technical side, cryptographic experts recommend the use of
**hybrid** algorithms that combine the strengths of PQC (to defend
against quantum attacks) with a proven conventional public key algorithm
(which guarantees at least the original security in case the new PQC
algorithm turns out to be less safe than expected). For example, early
versions of quantum-safe connections with the Chrome web browser use [a
combination of X25519 and Kyber-768
(ML-KEM)](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/08/protecting-chrome-traffic-with-hybrid.html).

Moreover, the practice of **cryptographic agility** is strongly
encouraged, meaning that security protocols can be easily updated and
replaced. This is a vague term that isn't just a software feature - it
requires alignment with business protocols and internal policies.

## FAQ

**Should I have knowledge of quantum mechanics? Should I understand
quantum hardware? **

When you are tasked with implementing early-stage quantum applications,
then yes!

As a strategic manager, or when working on post-quantum cryptography,
you do not need in-depth quantum knowledge. 

**What should I do first: focus on quantum applications or post-quantum
cryptography?**

For most organisations, the threat to security is more urgent,
especially because the migration trajectory can take several years (and
this must be completed well before we have large-scale quantum
computers!). 

However, most organisations work on both trajectories in parallel.
