> *“Quantum computing will change everything,” the man in front of me

> that…”*

> *"Well—" I tried to interrupt, but the man passionately rattled on.*

> *"It will finally enable us to build general Artificial Intelligence

> *“That's what most people think. But the reality is, we're closer than

> Quantum supremacy has already been achieved. Google did it in 2019.
> Since then, progress has been exponential. Did you see the

The above conversation captures a feeling that many seasoned experts in
quantum computing will have. And this is by no means exaggerated.
Plentiful reputable sources report that ‘quantum’ is key in [tackling
climate
change](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/quantum-computing-just-might-save-the-planet),
[revolutionising
AI](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/05/02/six-ground-breaking-industries-quantum-computing-is-projected-to-revolutionize/),
and building [unhackable
networks](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2368353-an-unhackable-quantum-internet-is-being-built-in-new-york-city/).

Experts who are actually *building* these quantum computers are much,
much more reluctant. At an academic conference, you hear a completely
different story. Scientists
[ridicule](https://twitter.com/DulwichQuantum) the absurd claims that
come from consultants and some aggressive startups. They will point out
that the applications of quantum computers are still very much
uncertain, and that we’re still searching for convincing uses of these
computers.

The quantum scene seems to have two completely separate worlds. A
business world, that reaches out to anybody who will hear them about the
unprecedented capabilities of quantum computers. And the academic world,
the community of experts that quietly bring this quantum computer to
reality, sharing their results in technical papers that require a PhD to
understand.

I was grasped by this paradoxical situation. What can we really expect
from quantum technology? How powerful are quantum computers really, and
how does this compare to other promising technologies? In what year will
we have a large-scale quantum computer, and what will it look like?
These are billion-dollar questions, but the answers will wildly vary,
depending on who you ask.

After searching for these answers for over a decade, I acquired a unique
position. I’ve become a native in both the academic and the commercial
world. I’ve seen all the arguments from both sides and can cut through
dishonest and deceptive claims. I have the privilege of being surrounded
by the world’s most renowned experts from both worlds, and I have heard
their unsalted opinions and predictions that they would never dare to
publicly announce. And most of all, after training many new colleagues
and setting up professional learning programs, I developed a good
intuition about what newcomers *want* to know about quantum technology,
and how to explain it in an accessible way.

I started writing these texts for two reasons. First, I aim to offer an
alternative to the hyped and unbalanced articles that would otherwise
populate the top entries in Google search results (or even the New York
Times [best-selling
books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Supremacy)). Second, I see
the need for a reliable source of information that others can reference
when disagreeing about facts or debunking myths. I am already very
grateful for the many colleagues who frequently refer to an early
version of this book!

That doesn’t mean that this book contains only confirmed facts – not at
all! Writing about a computer of the future comes with uncertainty. In
2005, nobody could have predicted that just a few years later, everyone
would be playing games and consuming the internet on their smartphones.
In 2015, nobody could have predicted the impact of Large Language Models
like ChatGPT. And indeed, today, our best predictions of a future
quantum revolution won’t be quite so accurate either.

Even worse, experts wildly disagree in several cases. For example, the
usefulness of quantum AI and optimization is continuously disputed, and
the rate at which hardware will progress depends on some yet-to-discover
breakthroughs. The best I could do is describe various perspectives on
these matters and highlight the best arguments from either side.

Without plentiful discussions and disagreements, I wouldn’t have been
able to gather the facts and opinions in this book. And it shouldn’t
stop there. I keep welcoming criticism, opinions, and feedback about
these complex topics, hoping to refine these texts even more in future
updates.

Even though much is still uncertain, I think that a reliable indication
of the prospects of quantum computing is more important than ever.
Quantum startups are acquiring huge investments, allowing them to hire
managers, software developers, salesmen, and marketers. Governments need
informed policymakers, and journalists should cover quantum
breakthroughs. Pretty much every organisation that deals with IT will
want to keep a close eye on the impact that ‘quantum’ will have on them.

This book is for precisely these people who don’t need to understand all
the technical details but still need to talk, read, and write about
quantum technologies. This is why I will focus on an accessible language
everyone can understand. We don’t care so much about the underlying math
or physics, but rather about the *functionality* of a quantum computer:
the opportunities, the threats, and the concrete actions organisations
can take.
