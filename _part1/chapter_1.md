Quantum is *hot*. As scientific researchers, we see more and more
interest from companies, governments, and geeky individuals who want to
dive into this exciting field. Back in the 90s, when the research group
at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica began the first pioneering
investigations, quantum technology was a purely academic exercise, very
much like highly abstract math. It sounded cool, but nobody bothered to
pay too much attention to real-world relevance. Today, we see
multi-million investments and frequent news coverage in national
newspapers. 

Sadly, we find that most of the 'accessible' articles are highly
inaccurate. It turns out to be incredibly challenging to make reliable
judgements! Firstly, the theory itself is hard to grasp and incredibly
confusing (there are
several[ paradoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_paradox) that
are practically impossible to not be fooled by). Secondly, much of the
future use of quantum technology is unclear: it's simply *not known *to
anyone when we'll have the first quantum computer, and how we'll use it!
And lastly, there's a new wave of businesses and startups that are
financially invested in quantum: it's important for them to sell their
product or service as a revolutionary technology, and the ones with the
most extreme claims are the ones who will be quoted in the media.

*For who is this guide?*

**We maintain this guide to offer a reliable and independent source of
information.** Additionally, this allows us to link to sources that we
think are reliable. We specifically target professionals who are willing
to invest a few hours of their time to gain a vision and an overview of
this topic that goes slightly deeper than the typical news article.
We're thinking of journalists, managers, IT or security specialists,
scientists and R&D staff from related fields, consultants or technology
scouts.

 

**What is it about?**\
Our goal is to make very clear:

-   **What **practical use-cases are foreseen for quantum computers and
    quantum networks (but also what they absolutely cannot do). 

-   **When** we can expect a quantum computer or network, and how far we
    are now.

-   What the societal impact is, for example on **cryptography**.

-   What the current quantum ecosystem looks like. 

-   Why you cannot trust every claim about quantum technology and what
    you should look out for.

-   When organizations should **start acting,** and how. 

 

**What this guide is not:**

-   An explanation of the math, physics or other technical aspects of
    quantum (for that, see the [Further
    Reading](https://new.quantum.amsterdam/further-reading-list-of-information-resources-about-quantum-computing/) page). 

-   An explanation
    of [quantum *sensors*.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_sensor) These
    by all means are an interesting technology, but they're beyond the
    scope of this guide. 

We aim to present Quantum **without going into much technical detail**.
Isn't that weird? Many people ask us: shouldn't you have some grasp of
quantum physics before you can understand the impact of quantum? Well,
we like to then return the question: *if you run a company that uses
conventional computers, do you need to master electrical engineering? Or
chip design?* We'd rather not care about how the device is built, but
focus on what end-users will do with them. 

Let's jump right into it, starting with the first part: Why are we so
enthusiastic about Quantum Technology?
