The field of quantum computing is evolving rapdily, and continuous discussion is essential to keep the contents accurate and up-to-date. In principle, I follow the broad concensus of scientists and experts, and never rely on just a single source or opinion. If you have feedback on the more subjective and speculative contents, the best way to convince me is by refering to comprehensive overview articles that analyze and cite a large body of literature, statements from reputable and independent organizations, or several aligning opinion pieces from established experts with a proven track record in the field.
